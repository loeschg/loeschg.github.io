<!-- ![loesch-headshot](/assets/headshot-thumb.jpg =250x) -->

I’m currently working as an Android Developer in the DC area.

I’m a general tech enthusiast, software engineer, hobbyist photographer, mid-skilled musician - I play piano and guitar and attempt to sing, an uninformed soccer fan, a pretend golfer, an occasional writer, enjoyer of a good outdoor adventure, and a follower of Christ.

You can find me on [github][], [LinkedIn][linkedin], [Twitter][twitter], [Google+][g+], and [Flickr][flickr].

Go Bucks and God bless!
