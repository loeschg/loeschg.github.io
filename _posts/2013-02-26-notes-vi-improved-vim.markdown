    U       - undoes all changes to the line
    ctrl+r  - redoes undo

**Write/quit with ZZ**

**Make new & join lines**

    J       - join the line below with the current line. 
    r<enter> - start a newline from that location.

**Repeat commands**

    .       - Repeat the previous command with the '.' key.

**'G'o to line**
    
    #G      -   Go to a specific line number. No argument assumes end of line.

**Vim macros**
