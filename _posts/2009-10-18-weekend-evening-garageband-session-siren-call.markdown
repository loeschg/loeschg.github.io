<p>I'm usually not one to post music that I've recorded, but I was somewhat pleased with how this "jam session" turned out last night. I usually start with some basic rhythm guitar and build from there. All effects and such were done using Garageband. Yes... I did layer my voice and use some (not T-Pain by any means) voice correction, so for any purists out there, I apologize.</p>
