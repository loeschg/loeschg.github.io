<img class="left" src="/assets/verizon-google-voice.jpg" alt="Verizon &amp; Google Voice" />I've been using Google Voice for about a <del>week</del> couple years now, and I thought I'd share a few things I've learned along the way... things related to using Google Voice with Verizon Wireless. I wanted and hadn't seen any resources out there regarding the Verizon + Google Voice duo, so I figured I'd put one together. This is a compilation of various things I've found on the Google Voice forums and from other sites.

For those of you who haven't heard, Google has a phone management system called Google Voice. This is now open <del>by invitation only</del> to everyone! Sign up <a title="Google Voice Invite" href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/googlevoiceinvite/">here</a> if you're interested. Google Voice provides you with a variety of different voice/phone services at the awesome cost of <strong>FREE</strong>. It primarily provides you with a central telephone number for all home, office, and mobile phones. It also provides you with free web access to voicemail and text messages, and allows personalization of voicemail messages. 

Instead of rattling off all the GV features, I'll let you check out the video Google has posted (see below). It gives you a pretty good overview. [Google Voice - YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4Q9MJdT5Ds)

Why use Google Voice? Check out this (video) article from [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5697196/the-most-helpful-ways-to-use-google-voice-that-youre-not-using).

On to the important stuff.

## Calling

#### Are my calls/texts in or out of network???

The very first thing most people want to know is how Google Voice will impact their current Verizon Wireless plan. The answer contains mixed news depending on your current plan. The bad news first. Any calls you place through Google Voice on your cell phone are considered <strong>out of network, and all text messages sent via GV are out of network, too.</strong> This is a deal breaker for most people. In case you're one of the discouraged, don't leave just yet. <strong>Know that you can use at least some of the GV features</strong> without having to give everyone your Google Voice number and <strong>without having to use precious out-of-network minutes</strong>. <a href="#voicemail">Click here to jump down the page to the features I'm referring to</a>.

However, the good news is if you have the circle of Friends and Family, you can essentially make unlimited phone calls by adding your Google Voice number as one of your Friends and Family numbers. How's this work? In order to call out using Google Voice, you have to first dial your GV number, then dial the number you want to call. Therefore technically every call is to Google Voice, who then redirects your call for free. I'd predict that Verizon will make this more difficult if GV continues to grow.

<strong>Update</strong> (The following is the latest on using GV with Verizon. [thanks, jay!]):

Okay if you use Google Voice and have your Google number in your circle all INCOMING calls are free. The Google Voice app uses random GV numbers to dial out. These calls are NOT free as they are not placed through you GV number although your GV number will show up on the recipients number.

To make free out going calls you need an app from the Android market called GV. Once you’ve set it up all you do is hit your phone button and it asks you [to dial] or [use] GV. Press GV and press your contact and GV automatically dials your Google Voice number, enters your pin, selects 2, and dials your contact number. You will hear all of this just as if you had manually dialed your own Google Voice number. I'm fairly certain the same goes for the mobile iOS application... though that's unconfirmed.

## Contacts 

#### Contacts &amp; New Phone Number Issues

Another question that seems to come up is how to not only effectively use your new number but also how to easily (re)organize contacts so that you do indeed get the most from Google Voice.

First of all, if you want to use Google Voice, then USE GOOGLE VOICE. A Lifehacker article I read encouraged GV users to firmly announce to to their friends, family, and co-workers that your GV number is your only number... even though your old number(s) still works :). By only handing out your new GV number to a select few people, you'll never be able to use GV to its full potential, and thus you'll never see the benefits.

<strong>---UPDATE (2/11/12)</strong>:

This section is not really as relevant as it once was. <strong>The most convenient way to use Google Voice is to download the mobile app for your Android, iPhone, or Blackberry</strong>. All provide a means to use your existing Contacts List to place calls.

<ul>
<li>If you're an Android user, once you download the app, every time you take action to make a call, you're prompted with the typical list of relevant applications that can perform the action. You'll have the choice to dial using Google Voice or the regular built-in phone application.</li>
<li>If you're an iPhone user, you have to take an extra step. If you want to dial out, you'll have to open the Google Voice app and dial the number. *insert Google fanboy comments... followed by Apple fanboy rebuttals.* If you're outside the US, there is apparently an app called GV Mobile that will allow you to use Google Voice by default. See more info <a title="GV Mobile" href="http://lifehacker.com/5227441/gv-mobile-makes-google-voice-the-default-for-your-iphone">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://gregloesch.com/images/2009/08/GoogleVoice.png"><img class="left" title="GoogleVoice" src="/assets/GoogleVoice-200x300.png" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>

<ul>
<li>If you're a Blackberry user, <del>get a new phone</del> I'm not sure... I don't have any experience with that. Somebody will have to fill me in.</li>
</ul>
---<strong>END UPDATE---</strong>

So... now that you're ready to jump into GV, how exactly do you "conveniently" call people using GV on your cell phone? The two obvious ways are to <em>call your GV number and dial out from there</em> or <em>call from the Google Voice home page</em>. Neither of those are very appealing on a basic Verizon phone (app is available for BlackBerry phones). Nobody wants to go through their entire phonebook and prepend each number with their GV number and appropriate pauses just to dial out using Google Voice.

Here was my, and certainly others, relatively simple solution, though it requires the slightest effort from your friends, family, etc. It turns out that when somebody texts your GV number, Google automatically assigns them a unique ID so-to-speak that's commonly referred to as a 406 number/ID. Read on... (<a title="Google Voice - Power of 406" href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/voice/thread?tid=22e341d7f6e3694a&amp;hl=en">More about the power of the 406 number here</a>.)

Say your Mom texts your GV number. Her phone number doesn't appear as you'd expect. It'll be some random number that starts with a 406 area code. From this point on, if you call or text that number, you'll call/text your Mom using your GV number (meaning that's what will show up on her caller id). Jump down to [texting info](#texting).

I took the Facebook Event route. I sent out a typical "I GOT A NEW NUMBER" event invitation on Facebook and kindly asked people to text me at my Google Voice number with their name and a friendly message. I disabled the wall so that people couldn't just post the number there (that does you no good in your current situation). Once you receive the text (should be a 406 area code), simply add that number as the contact's 'Mobile 2 contact,' or something of that nature. Now when you call that number, you're calling via Google Voice.

You can apparently import your contacts INTO Google Voice (not to your phone) using the technique described <a title="Verizon - Import contacts into Google Voice" href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/voice/thread?tid=158d9039bf5c36eb&amp;hl=en">here on the Google Voice Forums</a>. This Requires Verizon's Backup Assistant and online access to your Verizon account.

## Texting

<strong>---UPDATE (2/11/12)</strong>: The easiest way to text nowadays is to use the mobile applications for iPhone, Android, or Blackberry. All messages are sent and received through the Google Voice application.

Although it's not immediately evident <strong>you can text/SMS using your Google Voice # from your phone even if you don't have a BlackBerry, Android type phone, or iPhone</strong>. Although one of my favorite features of Google Voice is the ability to text right from my computer using my keyboard, it's not practical when on the go... obviously. In order to text using your GV number, you'll have to get each contact's unique 406 number (see <a href="#contacts">Contacts &amp; New Phone Number Issues above</a>). A more in-depth article can be found over at <a title="SMS with Google Voice" href="http://lifehacker.com/5316921/how-to-sms-with-google-voice-from-any-mobile-phone">this LifeHacker article</a>.

Things to note about Google Voice texting (viable to change once Google Voice progresses):

<ul>
<li><del>You are limited to receiving only 160 characters</del> GV allows more than 160 characters... might be split up in multiple messages</li>
<li>GV is not MMS (picture/video messages) compatible.</li>
<li>Standard text messaging rates apply when sending via cell phone (all texts are out of network)</li>
<li>You can't send text messages to "Short" numbers (such as Twitter's 40404 number)</li>
</ul>


## Voicemail

#### Voicemail and Using Google Voice Without Changing Your Number

<strong>---UPDATE(2/11/12)</strong>: This is now an added feature of Google Voice. Just follow the prompts given in your phone settings page on the Google Voice site or using the Google Voice application

This is an awesome little trick that I read about today (well... 1st time I understood what I read) that explains a simple free way to use all of the voicemail features of Google Voice on your cell phone regardless of whether the contact called your GV number or regular cell phone number. With this feature, <strong>anybody that calls your cell phone (GV or regular cell number) will be redirected to your Google Voice voicemail</strong>. This way you can keep your Verizon phone number and still manage voicemail online (replay/save messages to your computer) and get transcriptions.

To set this up, you need to setup a "Number Busy/No Answer Call" forwarding by following this simple step:

Dial the following:

<ul>
<li>*71 [Your GV #] then hit Send --- (*71-###-###-#### then Send)</li>
</ul>
You'll hear a few beeps and then you'll automatically be disconnected. This is a free Verizon calling feature that reroutes an unanswered call to the 10-digit number provided after the *71, which is your Google Voice number in this case. I set this up in just a few seconds, and a quick test from another phone confirmed that this worked. <a title="Missed Call/Ignore settings Forwarding - Google Voice" href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/voice/thread?tid=00a93855af6943b4&amp;hl=en">More information can be found at this Google Voice forum post</a>.

<strong>Update</strong> (Thanks, Vince!)

Turns out that this feature is free but not really FREE.

<blockquote>If you don't have the G-voice number in friends and family EVERY call forwarded to your voicemail is treated as an out of network call (and is charged against your minutes). [It] can add up quick[ly] because it uses a minimum of 1 minute for EVERY call sent whether a message is left or not [since] Google Voice answers it.
</blockquote>

## Conclusion/Thoughts

Google Voice has some great potential. I've only listed a fraction of the features that are available through GV. In my experience, I've found that the half-second delay/latency cancelled the benefits that I gained from the service. I also don't have the need to direct calls to different phones at different points in the day. I use my cell phone and only my cell phone. I do, however, use and love Google Voice for voicemail forwarding. I love getting voice transcriptions (despite the frequency of being <a href="http://gvtranscripts.tumblr.com/" title="GV Transcripts">terribly inaccurate</a>) and being able to easily save voicemails. I also love the custom voicemail greeting.  

If you have any other Verizon + Google Voice tips or corrections to the ones I've posted, feel free to leave me a comment below. Hope this helps you Verizon + Google Voice users out there.

    See the <a href=\"#voicemail\" rel=\"nofollow\">Voicemail and Using Google Voice
    Without Changing Your Number</a> section. It's just a nicer way to manage voicemail.
    \r\n\r\nAlso, if you have a landline, definitely take advantage of the other GV
    features! You can easily place a call using GV through your landline by using
    the web interface.\r\n\r\nFeel free to post more ?'s"

    forward all calls to gvoice.  verizon charges minutes for the forwarded calls
    because they act as the router/host for the phone call.  it's great for doing
    voicemail, but nothing more.  i have a buddy that made that mistake.  he thought

    through GV are free. You see when you place calls through mobile GV website they
    call you and then connect you to the number your dialing. If you have free incoming
    and unlimited pda data plan you are fine. I love using my GV#, however I'm waiting
    for the Verizon facists to ruin this soon.

    point here- when you use the *71 no-answer forwarding what happens is someone
    calls you, your cell phone rings, if you don't answer then Verizon forwards the
    call to your google voice VM. \r\n\r\nIf you want the have it go straight to voicemail-
    well, that means you don't want your cell phone to ring at all- I may be missing
    something here, but you can turn off your ringer... ?\r\n\r\nIf you want to decrease
    the number of rings that a caller hears when they call your verizon number, you
    can call verizon customer technical support - most people don't realize this-
    and Verizon can set the number of rings that you want before the person calling
    you is forwarded to your voicemail (or in this case, because you are using *71,
    before they are forwarded to Google V)\r\n\r\nYMMV"

    app.  I applied and set up my new GV number and it works fine.  I was under the
    impression that if you called someone or they called me on that GV number that
    it would run off of my data plan and not my weekday minutes.  Essentially I thought
    it would be free for me to call people.  I have the basic verizon plan of 450
    minutes in the week.  I've looked at my verizon usage report and it has a 1 minute
    call to my gv number but I went over my minutes last night testing my GV number
    by like an hour!  I guess I would like some clarification of whether or not I
    need to upgrade to the family and friends plan or not.  Thanks for everyones help

    When you place a call using GV, you (for the point of making an illustration)
    call Google voice (using Verizon's services) and then Google calls the appropriate
    party. Therefore each time you call using GV, it's as though you're always calling
    the same number. \n\nYeah, if you want to get \"unlimited\" calling using Google
    Voice, you'll have to go with a Friends and Family package and add your own Google
    Voice # to it. I'm pretty sure this still works with Verizon..."

    all INCOMING calls are free. The qgoogle inc google voice app uses random gv numbers
    to dial out. These calls are NOT free as they are not placed through you GV number
    although your GV number will show up on the recipients number.\r\nTo make free
    out going calls you need an app from the Android market called GV. Once you've
    set it up all you do is hit your phone button nad it asks you dialer or GV. Press
    GV and than contacts pop up press your contact and GV automatically dials your
    google voice number enters your pin selects 2. And dials your contact number.
    You will hear all of this just as if you had manually dialed your own google coice
    number. As much of a pain as using a calling card but the calls are free. My example
    is for an android phone that has a google voice account number in their calling
    circle. Hope this helps. If you don't have a android phone I guess you could set
    it all up under speed dial. FWIW"

    you state:\r\n    * *71 [Your GV #] then hit Send — (*71-###-###-#### then Send)\r\nand
    you also state:\r\nThis is a free Verizon calling feature that reroutes an unanswered
    call to the 10-digit number provided after the *71, which is your Google Voice
    number in this case.\r\n\r\nMy question is, this GV# you mention, the Google Voice
    number... I don't have a Google voice number. I'm trying to just to use Google
    voice to answer my unanswered Verizon mobile calls.\r\n\r\nSo what is the GV#
    or Google Voice number I'm supposed to put after the *71 if I don't have a Google
    Voice number?\r\n\r\nI've tried many times to set up this voicemail and I get
    a disconnected number message from Verizon anytime I call my own number (from
    another phone) instead of a voicemail message.\r\n\r\nMy phone rings, so I could
    potentially answer the phone but if I let it go it gets a disconnect phone number

    our conversations were at least 30 minutes each time  so after several calls it
    added up only google voice calls from computer to computer are free, unless you
    add the google voice number to your "friends and family" list. The friends and
