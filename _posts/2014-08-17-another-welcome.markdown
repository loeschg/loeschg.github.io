If you're viewing this post, I've officially migrated my blog away from Wordpress to [Jekyll][jekyll].

This was done mainly because I'm tired 
<!--more--> 
of paying money to host a bulky Wordpress site that is infrequently updated and has limited traffic :). I hope the simplicity and speed make me blog more, but we all know that goals are supposed to be attainable. 

With this migration comes a lot of article... purging. I will be selectively migrating posts from my old Wordpress site. Should I be missing an article that you desperately miss, feel free to drop me a line.
