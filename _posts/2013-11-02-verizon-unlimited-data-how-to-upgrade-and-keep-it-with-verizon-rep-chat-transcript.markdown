With Verizon, the process of transferring an upgrade from a line with unlimited data to a line without unlimited data will indeed let you <strong>get a new phone at contract price and keep unlimited data.</strong> I've seen numerous articles making the case for both sides of the story, and I've talked to reps that have also claimed both sides of the story. Pretty frustrating!

I did, however, just complete this process today (11/2/13) with success, purchasing a new LG G2. The transcript from my conversation is posted at the bottom of this post.

<!--more-->

<a href="http://www.droid-life.com/2013/09/17/keep-unlimited-data-verizon-upgrade/">Droid-Life</a> sums up the options pretty well:

<ol>
<li>Do something I like to call the TBAT [pronounce tee-bat] jig either in store or online:<br />
<strong>T</strong>ransfer upgrade from unlimited data number to other non-unlimited, <strong>B</strong>uy phone , <strong>A</strong>ctivate on non-unlimited line, <strong>T</strong>ransfer to unlimited number.</li>
<li>Buy at full price</li>
<li>Find an awesome Verizon rep to bypass stuff</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>It's not a problem. I understand the unlimited data is like GOLD! - Verizon Sales rep</blockquote>

I opted to first try the "TBAT" jig (see above) in store. This was a terrible experience. The store employee was very adamant that I was NOT able to transfer the upgrade and keep unlimited. She got a little salty when I asked her if we could try... which is understandable. I'd be upset if somebody told me how to do my job.

Distraught and questioning life, I went home and as an act of desperation I talked to a rep online. Yep, one of those "Click here to chat with a sales rep" pop-ups. They told me I was indeed able to do exactly what I said. She even said (and I quote), "It's not a problem. I understand the unlimited data is like GOLD!" She was super helpful and even ended up providing me with a promo code for an extra $50 off the phone! I've attached the full transcript at the bottom.

<h4>What worked for me</h4>
To clarify, my situation was as follows:

<ul>
<li>iPhone 4S (unlimited data) <strong>Upgrade available</strong> &lt;-- <em>Account I'm upgrading</em></li>
<li>Mom's dumb phone (no data plan)</li>
<li>I wanted to order the LG G2 to replace the iPhone 4S and keep unlimited data. Mom wanted to keep her dumb phone.</li>
</ul>
I successfully did the following online:

<ol>
<li>Transferred my upgrade from my iPhone 4S number to mom's dumb phone number</li>
<li>Ordered the LG G2 at the discounted rate (under mom's number)</li>
<li>Selected in store pickup</li>
<li>When picking it up at the store I informed the rep that I wanted to activate the new phone with my number per the Verizon rep's suggestion.</li>
<li>The rep worked some magic (I believe did the switching back and forth for me), and I was all set! The re-activation of the dumb-phone with my mom's number automatically reverted away from the $30 data plan back to the $10 talk/text plan.</li>
</ol>

It should be noted that the Verizon employee who helped me at the end said the online reps weren't supposed to encourage in store pickup for this scenario because it's a pretty long process for them. This guy in particular was the only one working the kiosk, and the line behind me got uncomfortably long. He said it's better to have the phone shipped to you and call in to get help activating. I'll let you decide what to do with that info :).

Hope that helps! If you find a rep that says it isn't possible, try online or maybe go in another day. If you have a Verizon rep connection, use it!


<h3>Online Transcript with Verizon Sales Rep (11/2/13)</h3>

    11/2/13 Chat Window You are now chatting with 'Alice'

    Alice: Hi! My name is Alice with the Verizon Wireless Sales Team. I am available to answer your questions and help you place an order. May I have your name, please?

    Greg: hey Alice, my name is Greg

    Alice: Hello Greg.

    Alice: How may I assist you today?

    Greg: I'm trying to get some clarification on using an upgrade to get a new phone at the discounted price.

    Greg: I have one line (Line A) that has the upgrade. It also has unlimited data. I have another line (Line B) that does NOT have a data plan.

    Greg: If I move my upgrade from Line A to Line B, get a new phone with Line B, activate it (with Line B), then reactivate the old phone (on Line B) and activate the new phone with Line A, will I lose unlimited data? :)

    Alice: No, you will need to use the upgrade from Line B and order your new device. Once you receive the device you can activate it on Line A and will not lose your unlimited data Greg.

    Greg: so if I transfer my upgrade from line A to line B, order the new device, I can directly activate on line A?

    Alice: Yes. That is correct. I'll be happy to walk you through the order process so there are not any issues for you Greg.

    Greg: awesome!

    Alice: Would you like to start the order process?

    Greg: yeah, sure. I'd like to do in store pickup if that's possible

    Alice: Great! Which device are you looking to purchase today?

    Greg: lg g2

    Alice: Fantastic choice Greg!

    Alice: I can save you $50.00 off that device as well today!

    Greg: very cool

    Alice: Once you pass the plans page and the insurance, you should see a box saying "Have promo code?"

    Greg: looking

    Alice: It will be on the shopping cart page.

    Greg: i see it

    Alice: Awesome Greg!

    Alice: There you will enter in xxxxxx. You will need to manually enter in that code, if you copy and paste it it will not work.

    Greg: that's awesome! Alice: I totally agree Greg!

    Alice: After that you will come to the customer information page, then will be the payment information page.

    Greg: entering that info now

    Alice: At the shopping cart page did you also select the pick up in store option?

    Greg: I did, yeah

    Alice: Okay, great!

    Greg: order completed. Thanks for your help!

    Alice: It's my pleasure Greg!

    Alice: May I have the order number to ensure your order went through?

    Greg: ############

    Alice: I see that your order is now pending. It will be ready to pick in stores in a few hours Greg!

    Greg: glad to hear.

    Greg: so when I get the phone, I can tell the rep that I want to activate with a different number?

    Alice: Thank you for your business and for choosing Verizon Wireless! Is there anything else I can help with today?

    Alice: Yes, that is correct.

    Greg: I do NOT need to activate first on the line without unlimited data?

    Alice: no, It will be best to activate once you get the device and can do it all while you have your LG G2 in hand.

    Alice: No, you will just need to tell them you want to activate the phone on line A Greg: Just wanting to make sure :). Sorry for making you repeat yourself

    Greg: I'm all set. Thanks again for the help and discount

    Alice: It's not a problem. I understand the unlimited data is like GOLD!

    Alice: It's my pleasure Greg!

    Alice: Thank you for your business today; I'm glad I was able to help you! At the end of this chat there is an opportunity for you to provide your feedback based on your experience with me today and to receive a copy of the chat. We would very much appreciate your thoughts.

    Greg: will do. have a good day

  content: "Hi Greg,\r\nThis is an absolutely a great post, and very timely for me
    - I hope ;-). \r\n\r\nMy situation  is as follows -  I have Verizon family plan
    w/ 3 phones - with unlimited data\r\n1. My, old as the hill's, original Droid
    w/ unlimited data that is upgradeable - but like you, I want keep my unlimited
    data\r\n2. My wifes Apple 4s phone - no upgrade yet available for this\r\n3. My
    wife's mother dumb phone - like your moms - a $10 monthly add on to our family
    plan\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n1. Did doing any of this intrupt your mom's dumb phone
    service? ( I can't do that bc  she needs to have uninterupted service).\r\n\r\n2.
    When you said you got the LG G2 at \"contract price\", did you mean you got the
    G2 at the full month-to-month (list) price, or at the discounted price you normally
    would pay with a 2yr upgrade plan extension? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any
    help you can provide! I have my fingers crossed that I can hopefully emulate exactly
    what you did.\r\n\r\nRegards ,\r\nDavid"

    regard to #1, I can't tell you for sure that the service was uninterrupted on
    the dumb line (your wife's in your situation)... my mom was fine being without
    service for a short period of time (< 15 minutes to my knowledge). We actually
    didn't even have to do anything to re-activate the old phone. Tough to say what
    steps the rep took. \r\n\r\nIn regard to #2, I got the phone for the discounted
    2 year upgrade plan extension (paid around $100). Really awesome!\r\n\r\nHope
    things work out for you!"

    swapping SIM cards when you go through this process, which, since I'm also going
    from an old iphone to a non-iphone, would be near impossible. Did you have to
    do anything with regard to SIM cards or did the store tech say anything about
    them?

    a month and remove the unlimited data from the original line with the upgrade
    (i.e., in your case the line with the iPhone 4S).  Seeing at it's been almost
    a month since you did your upgrade, I was curious to see if anything similar had
    happened to you?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDavid"

    my situation is slightly different, because I used the upgrade from an unlimited
    line onto a line that already has a smartphone w/ a normal data plan and it never
    prompted me to change that at all, or even gave me the ability to change it, say
    from 2GB to 4GB. Coincidentally it showed the date to upgrade changing from one
    of the the other as well. The line I just transferred the upgrade to, we done
    back in May/13 so it only extends it out 6 mos but it shows my unlimited now as
    being up in May 15. I just finished going thru the process, so I cannot speak
    to whether or not they catch up on the billing, but I thought I'd share the caveat
    that, it never prompted me to do anything with data package selection so it was
    done on a smartphone.\r\n\r\n-C"

  content: "Hi Greg,\r\n An update - I was able to do the \"TBAT\" 2 step and get
    a new Note # and keep my Unlimited Data- at same monthly rate. Woot woot !   I
    too had some issues convincing the Chat folks to do this; so I copied pasted you
    dialogue in to my chat session, and that seemed to help quite a bit!\r\n\r\nThe
    only problemn I had was when Chat rep said they would charge me to setup a data
    plan for my \"dumb\" phone - but there was never really an actual cost/charge
    to me on this - bc I completed the full 2 step process before a bill was sent
    - and there was no interuption of phone service on my \"dumb\" phone either! \r\n\r\n
    I also had my phone shipped to me, vs going to a B&amp;M shop as you did, I just
    had to have a second chat sesison with another Verizon rep wehen I got my new
    phone. I ordered my phone (Note 3) thru Version - but I think maybe this process
    might be able to be done by ordering the new phone thru Amazon/etc to get an even
    lower price - but I'm not sure- someone can try that too.  But I'm very happy
    with what this process did - even so.\r\n\r\nMANY THANKS to you for sharing your
    experience on doing this!!!!!  As you know, there's a LOT of misinformation on
    the internet about doing this (most say you have to by a new phone at list price/etc),
    and it was wonderful finding this actual real world dialogue how-to!  \r\n\r\nThanks
    again! (and I passed this tip onto several co-workers as well - paying it forward
    ;-)"

  content: "I called Verizon last week to talk about helping out a friend. Believe
    it or not, I do NOT own a smart phone. I don't need one, as I have an Ipod touch
    and an Ipad that works great and when/if I need to be connected while not home
    I pick up wifi in most stores and no, I do not make credit card transactions with
    my Ipod touch. Anyway, on verizon wireless.com we are eligible for a free/discounted
    phone every 2 years- now with a $30.00 upgrade fee. I have a friend who is in
    bad financial shape, is a Verizon customer and has an old Iphone 4. I asked Verizon
    since I was eligilble for an Iphone 4S for 99 cents, plus the upgrade fee of $30.00-
    could I give that phone to my friend as a gift since I don't need a smartphone
    as the fee of $40.00-$50.00 a month JUST for data is INSANE to me,unless can write
    it off on my taxes, I am NOT paying that money. My friend is also eligible for
    a new phone, however she has the old Unlimited data,talk and text from over 2
    years ago and doesn't want to loose that amazing package and if she upgraded her
    phone ON her own she would loose that Unlimited everything plan. \r\nOk, the jist
    is this folks- IF you give a new Verizon phone to a friend in need like mine,
    then that does NOT change their current data plan. It's only when they upgrade
    on their own, does it then change their plan. Got it? So, if you're able to help
    someone out as I plan to do next week, then why not. Good karma folks. All she
    has to do is activate the new Iphone 4S I am going to give her and since it's
    a gift, her UNLIMITED everything plan that shes had for years and never want to
    give up, stays in effect. \r\n\r\nI encourage all of you to take advantage of
    the free/well almost free/ Verizon phone you are all eligible for online and just
    store them aside for a rainy day. That came in handy a year ago,when I accidentally
    ran over my phone with my car Luckily, I had a brand new phone stored away and
    I easily activated it from my house. \r\n\r\nI will never forget the Verizon associates
    reaction on the phone when I told her what I was planning on doing. Initially,
    she sounded frazzled when she first answered the line, but as I told her my intentions
    she started to tear up an said this is what its all about, giving back. We should
    all try to pay it forward more. \r\nPeace\r\n\r\nps: If you are a Veteran or Active
    Military they are now giving 15% discounts, fyi. Just call them or go to one of
    Their stores."

  content: This is very cool. I have a little different instructions from both a Verizon
    Rep via phone support and a friend who has done this with the assistance of a
    different Verizon rep via phone support. Anyway, our scenario is a little different.
    We both have 5 phones on one account. Not all of them are smart phones, and their
    contracts all expire at different times. Basically, you upgrade one of the other
    phones that is either a dumb phone or has a limited data plan. One rep says when
    you receive the new phone activate it as normal for one day, then switch back
    and put the new device on your unlimited line. My friend managed to keep the upgrade
    on his unlimited line by doing this. Even after the new device was acitve on his
    line. The other rep says, no, call the activation phone number from a landline
    and press 2 to activate later. Then put the new device on your unlimited line
    either by calling them or using the web. I haven't done this yet so I don't know
    what I'm in for. But my suspicion is that I'll lose the upgrade on my unlimited
    line by doing this. Either way, you are accepting the new terms and conditions
    of extending the contract,  and at that point, you own the new device. So you're
    supposed to be able to do whatever you want to with it. I think you could even
    auction it off at twice the price if you wanted to. Or give it away as Gina Marie
    suggested. Hope this helps someone else too !  Good luck !

  content: Great information everyone and a big thanks to Greg for taking the time
    to help the rest of us out.  My situation is similar, but different.  I have 4
    lines, 2 on unlimited data and 2 on 4 GB data monthly.  All four are eligible
    for upgrades.  My plan is to add another line with a dumb phone (for another kid
    in the Fam), then transfer an upgrade to it like others have done.  Thing is I
    need to transfer 4 upgrades.  My thought is, I'll have to sign a new 2 year contract
    on the dumb phone line each time and I believe it would just extend it for 2 years
    from that day.  In other words, if I transferred one upgrade yesterday, I would
    have a two year contract from yesterday.  Then if I transferred another upgrade
    to the dumb phone today, I would have to sign another 2 year contract - I assume
    that contract would be up 2 years from today, not add another 2 years on top,
    but I'm not sure until I do it.  If they tack it on top, I would essentially have
    2 years to add the dumb phone line, then another 2 years for each upgrade transfer
    = 8 year contract.  I don't think it works that way, I think one contract would
    replace the other.  If anyone has any experience with this, I'd appreciate some
    advice.  I plan on upgrading to the Note 3 for all four, which is some serious
    coin, I plan on doing it towards the end of Feb 14.  I'll let you know how it
    went.

  content: "Ok, I just called verizon customer service and chatted online with a person.
    They both told me you can't transfer and activate on your own line. This is the
    reason, once you transfer and order the new phone, they automatically renew the
    contract for the original upgrade. So I have 3 lines, mine is unlimited, the other
    2 is pay as you go $30 per month for 2 gb. I told them I wanted to transfer my
    upgrade to one of the other lines, upgrade the phone and activate on my line.
    They said once you upgrade on the other line, my contract automatically gets extended,
    and therefore I would have to pick a new data plan.\r\n\r\nDid anyone else get
    this? Please help. I had my s3 for over 2 yrs, and need to badly upgrade to the
    note 3."

  content: "Joe- I just called Verizon today. I was told that I can upgrade a non-smart
    phone- that had an eligible upgrade to the HTC One. Then I can switch the HTC
    One to my other line- that currently has a RAZR with unlimited data. And go back
    to the non-smart phone package for the upgraded line. I do think that the non-smart
    phone line contract will be renewed to a 2-year contract. But the line with the
    RAZR would not be- as it wold be like I am buying an unlocked phone and putting
    it on my account. I ordered the phone today thru Amazon- who I also spoke to and
    they said pretty much the same thing. I don't see why you could not upgrade one
    of your 2GB phones to the Note3, then move the Note3 to the unlimited line, and
    put the original 2GB phone back on the plan. Your 2GB data plan would probably
    get renewed for 2 years. \r\n\r\nBob"

  content: Okay this sounds like a good plan but what happens when you need to upgrade
    Line B and you have no upgrade on Line A to transfer to Line B. you could wait
    the 2 years but then Line B wouldnt be able to upgrade again for 4 years. right?

  content: "Okay I have a few questions, 1. I've got 2 lines (both smart) one tiered
    and one unlimited, am I correct in thinking this option won't work with my situation?
    \r\nMy mom has a plan with my sister (totally different account) could she upgrade
    a phone (their both on tiered plans), use it for a few hours/days, and transfer
    it to me without loosing my unlimited data?\r\nI've also been looking at eBay
    for phones but if i can, I'd rather pay 299. for the phone vs eBay and ESP don't
    feature having to pay full price for a phone."

    plan in my situation. Thanks.\r\n\r\nI have 2 iPhones 4s and 2 LG phones for my
    parents (non-smart phones) on my account. My contract for all 4 phones will expire
    in April of 2014. I do have unlimited data on 2 iPhones. I have checked my Verizon
    account on the web and it does telling you to give up your unlimited and get a
    2G, or else.  Thank you"

  content: "The TBAT plan worked for me, but only online - I tried two different stores
    and both told me they couldn't do it, that even if I transferred the upgrade,
    I would actually be extending the contract on my unlimited data line and therefore
    have to get a new plan.  I chatted with two different people online, one told
    me the same as the store and the other said it could be done.  I figured I had
    nothing to lose so I tried it online  and it worked.  The only difference is that
    my husband actually kept the new phone (iphone 5c) and I transferred his old phone
    (iphone 4s) to my unlimited data line b/c my phone was broken.  I think it would
    have worked just as easily if I wanted the 5c for my line, I would have activated
    it online the same way then called to transfer it to my line and re-activated
    the 4s on his line.   He has his upgrade in a year, so I'll upgrade mine then
    - I'll try the same thing (except I won't have to transfer the upgrade) but if
    it doesn't work, at least I would have extended my data plan for an extra year
    .\r\n\r\nSo anyway, if you try in retail store (twice!) and get rejected, try
    online.  When I transferred the upgrade it said \"your current data plan will
    work with your new phone\" (or something like that) - he already has the 2 gb
    data plan.  When I experimented and tried to upgrade my phone instead of transferring
    the upgrade, it wanted me to select a new data plan."
