excerpt: "\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"http://greg-loesch.com/pics/apple.jpg\"
  alt=\"Apple\" height=\"242\" width=\"242\" /></p>\r\nFor those of you who haven't
  seen Apple's latest unveiling, head over to <a href=\"http://apple.com\" title=\"Apple\"
  target=\"_blank\">Apple.com</a>... NOW! Okay, it's not that big of a deal - at least
  for some of you. Maybe it's not going to change your life immediately like the latest
  session with <em>Dr. Phil</em>... hmm...is he affected by the writer's strike?...
  but if it doesn't make you at least mutter \"Wow, that's amazing\" or something
  of that sort, you need to see a therapist, psychologist, or some other shrink-like
  professional, as your threshold of awe may borderline on beyond repair.\r\n<p class=\"paragraph_style\">&nbsp;</p>\r\nApple
  just introduced a new laptop aptly called the MacBook Air. I saw this for the first
  time about 15 minutes ago, and I still am slightly dumbfounded. 0.16-0.76\" thin!
  Wow! That's less than 1/4 of an inch at the smallest section and the largest part
  is still only about 3/4 of an inch... that's about the size of my thumbnail. This
  sexy thing weighs only 3 lbs., too. That's a good 2+ lbs. lighter than both the
  MacBook and MacBook Pro!\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"http://greg-loesch.com/pics/macAir.png\"

  content: "Amen!  That Air looks amazing, although I'm a desktop guy and probably
    won't convert for a while (I need the hard drive space).  Nice post.  The layout
    of your blog looks terrific.  I would think about converting to WordPress if I
    hadn't already changed websites about 10 times.  I noticed you were using iWeb
    and switched.  I did the same thing.  iWeb just isn't good for blogging, and like
    you, I found I posted much more after switching.  Although I do maintain an iWeb
    site for a sort-of part-time business I'm trying to start.\r\n\r\nI added your
    blog link to my page because you post some well-written entries.  I'm hoping it
    will inspire me to do better.\r\n\r\nMatt"

  content: "I'd be more of a desktop guy myself if it wasn't for the whole college
    thing. I like having the option of taking it to class... But yeah, the Air is
    crazy! \r\n\r\nRegarding your comments, thanks! I found a template I liked, and
    I tinkered around a bit with some of the code to get everything to my liking.
    This is my first real experience with WordPress. It definitely has its limitations,
    but it has tons of features and sure beats blogging with iWeb, ha ha. I'm going
    to start moving my Mac tips section over to this, too. It's just so much easier.
    \r\n\r\nI also added your blog link in my blogroll (though it doesn't look to
    be showing up... perhaps it takes some time?). Yeah, I figure we can both use
    a little more publicity. \r\n\r\nGlad to find somebody with mutual interests!\r\n\r\nGreg\r\nhttp://greg-loesch.com"

Okay, enough of the shouting and multiple !'s on my end. Now that my infatuation has been lowered from a rolling boil to a simmer, let's take a look at what really matters: the inside. This thing may not be packed with the latest and greatest power, but remember to keep all this in perspective. All this power is packed into 3 lbs. With the starting price of $1,799 and the upgraded version starting at an astounding $3,089, the MacBook Pro may be a more attractive computer for the $$. For about $200 more than the base MacBook Air you can get an added 40GB of hard drive space (and a faster hard drive, I believe), an added 0.6 GHz of processor speed, about 2" of added display space, an <em>internal</em> SuperDrive (CD/DVD-RW), a better video card, and a few other minor features. However you'd be missing out, aside from the weight, look, etc., on the multi-touch trackpad (yes, that's what the iPhone is somewhat famous for) and possibly the solid-state hard drive. If you haven't heard of these hard drives before, check them out on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=solid+state+hard+drive&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" title="Solid-State Drives">Google</a>. I don't have the space to talk about that here and now.</p>

<p>So if it was you, what would you pick? Sleak, lean, and sexy? Or powerful and semi-sexy? That's a tough choice in my opinion. I'm just glad this wasn't an option when I was in the market for a laptop for school.</p>

<p>It's exciting and I suppose somewhat scary to think about what it's going to be like a couple years from now. My parent's tell me how easy I have it now programming on the computer. Will I be saying the same thing to my kids? The possibilities do seem endless. Fold-able screens have been and are continually in the process of being designed (I found an article from back in <a href="http://www.masternewmedia.org/video_display/portable_screens/rollable_portable_screens_prototypes_first_looks_20050712.htm" title="Fold-able Screens">2005</a> telling about them!). Keyboards are being projected by laser onto any flat surface. Chips the size of my pinky nail are easily holding multiple gigs worth of information. I'm telling you the truth. Computers that include a comfortably sized screen that are able to fit into your jean's pocket are really not that far away.</p>

<p>One last thing... check out the advertisement <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/#ad" title="MacBook Air Ad">here</a>. Again... WoW!</p>
<p class="paragraph_style">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until next time...</p>
