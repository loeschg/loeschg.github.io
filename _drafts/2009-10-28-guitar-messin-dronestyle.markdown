excerpt: "This was an unfinished blog post from a few weeks ago that I thought I'd
  post. I was watching an Acoustic Guitar Techniques podcast and this was my application
  of the <em>Drones and Chord Relations</em> lesson.\r\n\r\nLike a lot of guitar principles/techniques,
  this was something a lot of you guitarists have probably already messed around with
  without knowing the proper name for it. It involves constantly picking (droning)
  on open strings (usually b and high e) while changing finger positions on other
  strings. It's relatively easy and comfortable to play, and the open strings give
  it a \"full\" sound making it fun to jam with by yourself.\r\n\r\nHere's my drone

<p>This was an unfinished blog post from a few weeks ago that I thought I'd post. I was watching an Acoustic Guitar Techniques podcast and this was my application of the <em>Drones and Chord Relations</em> lesson.</p>
<p>Like a lot of guitar principles/techniques, this was something a lot of you guitarists have probably already messed around with without knowing the proper name for it. It involves constantly picking (droning) on open strings (usually b and high e) while changing finger positions on other strings. It's relatively easy and comfortable to play, and the open strings give it a "full" sound making it fun to jam with by yourself.</p>
<p>Here's my drone diddy:<a id="more"></a><a id="more-481"></a></p>
<p>[wpaudio url="http://gregloesch.com/audio/dronediddy.mp3" text="Drone Diddy" dl="0"]</p>

<p>As usual, this was recorded with GarageBand, my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012AUHXW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=grlomatitranm-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0012AUHXW">SnowFlake mic</a>, and Larrivee LV-03 acoustic guitar. I started with the base "droning" and layered a little acoustic lead on top... which is probably obvious... who actually starts with lead?</p>
<p>For the record, this is the podcast link (Go to Advanced -&gt; Subscribe to Podcast)... though I think it went bye bye.<br />
(http://stream.ivideosongs.com/podcasts/itunes/ivs_acousticguitartechniques.xml).</p>
<p>Until next time...</p>
