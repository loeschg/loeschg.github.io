    me for not knowing that.  \r\n\r\nAnd for B - I own (and absolutely love) a Kindle.
    \ I can read books, check my facebook and/or read a newspaper.  Slowly, but I
    can read it.\r\n\r\nIf I were you I would go for the IPad.  You can read books
    AND use it as a phone with Skype (I think).\r\n\r\nI feel like you, eventually
    I will own both but the IPad is a clear winner just because of versatility.\r\n\r\nJust
    my two cents"

  content: "I saw this post and felt that I had to comment.  Jeff and I both got Kindles
    for Christmas and we love them.  My mom got an iPad and we were playing with hers
    when we were in NJ.  They're both pretty awesome.  Personally, I think you should
    get the kindle, then when a newer (and possibly cheaper??) model comes out, buy
    that version.  Hopefully, by that time, you'll be working at Northrup in MD and
    will have $$ for both items. \r\n\r\nWe miss you tons.\r\nHappy New Year."

    - I'm leaning toward waiting for the next iPad. I didn't mention it, but the rumors
    also complicate my decision. There's a lot of buzz saying that the next gen iPad
    is being released Feb/March 2011... speculation of an announcement end of January.
    Leaks of new cases with a camera hole are out there... see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTFYnLn_qNo.\r\n\r\n@David

<p>Let me start this post off by saying that I’m pretty sure I have a pretty good grasp that there are way more important things to be worrying about than what I’m about to write about.  The Koreas may be going to war, people are still unemployed and hungry/homeless, and American Idol will be without Simon. I understand that I’m blessed (or is it a blessing...) to have the financial means to even begin to debate this. Hopefully this communication of my understanding of my circumstances will take away a bit of that troll sustenance. Anyhow...</p>
<p>I am tearing my hair out trying to decide between getting an iPad or a Kindle. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-658"></a>If you aren’t interested in one or the other (tablet/ebook reader), I’m going to venture a guess and say you just haven’t taken the time to think about it. Or maybe you just don’t read... shame on you :). I asked for either/or for Christmas. I honestly think I just wanted my parents to make that decision for me for Christmas. They didn’t even need to buy me anything. What do they do instead? They give me cash and thus fuel my indecisiveness. I’m not ungrateful. Complaining about a Christmas gift from my parents is like... I don’t know... it’s just stupid. Plain and simple. My parents are awesome and bless me in more ways than you know.</p>
<p>I just cannot get the collective list of pros and cons of one device to outweigh the other. The Kindle (or insert any other e-ink device) is supposedly best if I just want a device for pure reading... which is the main reason I want a tablet/ebook reader. However, like lots of other people I’m sure, I look at the iPad and realize how much functionality I can get out of it. I can watch movies, get email, browse the internet, read school slides, play games, use it as a stinkin’ awesome digital picture frame, etc. The iPad functionality is a double-edged sword though... who needs more distractions, right? I can do everything the iPad offers on my computer... but tablet form is way WAY more convenient and comfortable for doing computer basics and consuming media (books, videos, web feeds, etc).</p>
<p>The trouble I’m running into is not just price.<strong> I’m convinced that both are different enough products that I could have both and not feel major overlap</strong>. I’m not alone in this thinking (see <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2371429,00.asp">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2371429,00.asp</a>). I want both and will probably own both at some point in time. As a college student, though, I’m pretty sure there’s a rule that says if you have an iPad and a Kindle, then you’re a chotchberger.</p>
<p>I could get a Kindle and save myself a few hundred bucks, but I wouldn’t have color or web/video capabilities... or Angry Birds &amp; Fruit Ninja! I could then get a next gen iPad (rumored Feb/March 2011) later.</p>
<p>I could get an iPad and have the ultimate media device. It will do everything the Kindle does and more with the only downsides being a little extra weight, potential eye-strain, and a bigger chunk out of the pocket.</p>
<p>Sick to your stomach yet at my desire for earthly possessions? My apologies. Let’s go sponsor a child <a href="http://www.compassion.com/">http://www.compassion.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Help me make my decision. Cheers!</p>
