<p>If any of you are like me, online games are interesting for about... 15 minutes. By that time, you've experienced about everything there is to experience. Sure, you may not have mastered the double-back flip with 360 twist inÃ‚Â <a href="http://www.miniclip.com/games/mountain-bike/en/" target="_blank" title="Mountain Bike">Mountain Bike</a>, but you understand the gist of the game. There's usually not a whole lot of depth...</p>
<p>I hadn't really touched online games since the golden days of Shockwave - back when you could actually keep track of the number of online games at shockwave.com - until recently.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-88"></a></p>
<p>To be honest, it probably started back up with the whole Pac-Man game on Facebook. That then transitioned to JetMan for a few days, until I started dabbling in Facebook's U-Arcade. The hook for those games wasn't content, however. It was all about the competition. As soon as I realized that I would never be able to score 60,000+ points (darn you Sam!) in Pac-Man - as my high-score was like 32,000... maybe - it lost its appeal. I didn't put forth as much effort, but JetMan was more or less that same way. Later I found out that people cheated and actually edited the code to eliminate the boundaries... *sigh.*Ã‚Â <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ee" class="Apple-style-span"></span></p>

<p>This all changed when I was recommended to check out the gameÃ‚Â <a href="http://www.handdrawngames.com/DesktopTD/game.asp" target="_blank" title="DTD">Desktop Tower Defense</a>. Ã‚Â Perhaps this game is old news, but it's new and relatively addicting to me. It has earned a spot in my bookmarks menu bar in Safari (yes, I've switched back... again). It's challenging, yet it doesn't feel impossible to beat (on medium and there are more difficulties). Also, there's something really addicting about games that allow you to upgrade your equipment. If only they added more of a random item or some similar aspect, we'd have a grade A addicting game (case and point? World of WarCraft).</p>
<p>In case any of you do start playing DTD, here's a little tip. Upgrade a basic tower 5 times, it becomes a sniper tower that kills! Great range and packs a lot of punch. Everything that's upgraded 5 times becomes something a lot kooler apparently.</p>
<p>Just this weekend, I discovered the "escape" genre of online games. In this genre, your goal is pretty simple: Escape. You're placed in an what looks like an ordinary room, and you have to find clues, use logic, and solve puzzles by pointing and clicking on different objects. They can be horribly frustrating at times, but it's really satisfying when you figure something out. The endings can be somewhat of a letdown, but they're quite fascinating. I've played and completed three since I found out about these games. The 1st one I played (<a href="http://jayisgames.com/archives/2008/02/vision.php" title="Vision" target="_blank">Vision</a>) reminded me a lot of Myst, for those of you who played that, minus about 20+ hours of gameplay :). I wouldn't start with that one, as I think it's probably one of the best (or perhaps you should if you want to be hooked). Two other good ones are apparentlyÃ‚Â <a href="http://jayisgames.com/archives/2007/06/rgb.php" target="_blank" title="RGB">RGB</a>Ã‚Â andÃ‚Â <a href="http://jayisgames.com/archives/2007/03/sphere.php" target="_blank" title="Sphere">Sphere</a>.</p>

<p>I ran into the siteÃ‚Â <a href="http://jayisgames.com" title="Jay Is Games" target="_blank">jayisgames.com</a>Ã‚Â more-or-less by accident, and it looks to have some links to some pretty good games. If you ever get bored, you might check any of those games out. Call me a little kid... I really like/liked them. Feel free to post links to any of your favorite games below.</p>
<p>Until next time...</p>
