<p>Before you write this post off as a tech rambling, give it a shot. This post is not so much about computers and related but about a battle between two businesses, marketing, customer satisfaction, and arguably ethics.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a little about what's going on in this current business "affair."</p>
<p>Back in January, MacHeist, an online company, offered one of their software bundles for $50. This package contained multiple well-known Mac applications that in and of themselves cost over the price of the package. These applications were promised to be full versions, as if we had directly purchased from the company who made each individual application.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-64"></a></p>
<p>For many of us Mac users, it was almost too good to be true, which was the case for me. Pixelmator alone was reason enough for me to purchase. I was looking for a simple photo editor before Christmas, and Pixelmator looked to be a viable solution. Christmas came and went, and I was still without Pixelmator. I figured it was worth spending my own money on, and as I was about to buy it from Pixelmator's website, I stumbled upon the MacHeist bundle. I had to read the offer a couple different times to make sure I wasn't being duped; that's how good it was. For me, I got $10 off Pixelmator plus numerous other applications to tinker around with. That made me extremely happy. I've incorporated a few of the applications into my everyday computer life that I otherwise would have never known about.</p>
<p>One of the programs included in this bundle was Speed Download 4 by Yazsoft. This program is simply a download manager/enhancer. It wasn't my favorite of the programs, but I stilled incorporated it into my computer workflow. After barely a couple weeks, Speed Download prompted me to upgrade to a new version upon boot. I clicked "yes," as every other human being would do, and was automatically upgraded to the new Speed Download 5.</p>
<p>My initial thoughts? "Hey, sweet! A new upgrade!" Soon, a window popped up, and I was prompted to enter my software license and registration name. *Uh oh...* I dug up my serial key (thank goodness for AppShelf), entered it into the proper field, and clicked register.</p>
<p>"Invalid Serial Key"</p>
<p>Great. I hopped on over to their website to confirm my suspicion. Sure enough, Speed Download 5 was a paid upgrade. This is where things start to get messy. After a little more reading, Yazsoft has posted that all users who had purchased within the past month were entitled to free upgrades. *Score!* I emailed them my registration info as instructed, and I played the waiting game. Soon I got an email (apparently automated) that told me how to uninstall Speed Download 5 and reinstall Speed Download 4.</p>
<p>?????</p>
<p>What did that have to do with anything? Apparently they assumed that I didn't want to pay for the upgrade THAT THEY FORCED OUT and were telling me how to go back to 4. I sent another email asking for clarification, and I was told "MacHeist purchases do not qualify for free upgrades but rather discounted ones at $15." *insert curse word* I quickly went over to their site to find the text I just quoted added to their site. I'm pretty sure it wasn't originally there... that's not right.</p>
<p>Despite their emphatic denial, Yazsoft obviously had used MacHeist purely as a promotion for their new product. Heck, they probably thought a gold mine fell into their lap when they were offered a shot at being a part of the MacHeist bundle, realizing their new upgrade was ready to be released anytime. This greatly unnerved me, as I felt as though I was being manipulated. Plus, I was promised a <em>full retail version</em> with the bundle!</p>
<p>I headed over to MacHeist forums a few days later to find that I was obviously not the only unhappy one. There were pages and pages and pages of questions (seriously would take about an hour to filter through the three different threads) posed to both Yazsoft and MacHeist. Both companies had posted in the forums informing all of us MacHeisters what was going on. Long story short, the companies were and still are in disagreement with each other. One of the MacHeist moderators/directorate actually called Yazsoft "weasels." I'm extremely irritated with them pulling the stunt that they did. My loyalties will undoubtedly stray elsewhere if a similar program is released by another company. It's downright cold the way Yazsoft handled/is handling the situation. If they would have simply waited a month or so to release the update, not forced through the update, and informed all of us MacHeisters beforehand that we would not get the upgrade this would all be a different story simply titled "MacHeisters disappointed in Speed Download upgrade." Making a mistake is one thing but completely denying a mistake and pointing blame on others is... immature.Ã‚Â  To top it all off, Yazsoft has stopped responding completely to customer emails.</p>
<p>MacHeist, on the other hand, doesn't escape from this one unscathed, either. Sure Yazsoft screwed them (and us), but the MacHeist directorate have seemingly done very little to communicate with us as of late. While there's quite a stir regarding "verbal contracts," I tend to stray to the side that says MacHeist should have drawn up a contract. This agreement doesn't seem like it would have been that difficult to create. I trust they're working as fast as they can for their customers, but I'd just like to hear SOMETHING from them to know we're not being left in the cold.</p>
<p>Yazsoft's most recent move was to offer Speed Download<em> 6 </em>as a free upgrade to all MacHeist customers. Yes, I said 6, not 5. I really have a difficult time understanding the logic behind Yazsofts move. I believe their argument is that some people have already purchased Speed Download 5, and it would be unfair to them. Would it be that hard to give us all our free upgrade to 5 and simply refund the others that bought it their money? I guess I'm glad to hear that something's being done, but there's been no word as to whether or not this is the final decision. Heck, how long is it going to be before this update is released? Will I even remember that I'm entitled to the free license? It seems like this is the whole "mail-in-rebate" ploy. You offer the discount and hope nobody takes advantage. I sure hope I'm notified one way or another of this.</p>
<p>I just want a decision to be made, so we can all put this in the past. Until next time...</p>
