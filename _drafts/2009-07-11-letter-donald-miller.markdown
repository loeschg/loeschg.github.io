excerpt: "Dear Donald Miller,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, allow me to introduce myself to
  you... possibly for a second time. My name is Greg Loesch, and I'm currently a student
  at the Ohio State University. I'm a fellow believer and follower of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nWithout
  meaning to tempt you into prideful thoughts, I'd like to tell you that I thoroughly
  enjoy your books - particularly <em>Through Painted Deserts</em><em>. </em>I also
  read your blog occasionally and heard you speak when you campaigned for Obama this
  past fall. I actually even shook your hand before you autographed one of my books
  as I commented on an email you had written to Obama discussing your trip to Starbucks
  in which you tried to fill your Nalgene bottle with frappuccino. So... moving on
  to the main point of this letter."

  content: "Yeah, I actually got unblocked within 24 hours of posting this. One of
    my friends sent Don a tweet linking to this.\r\n\r\nDon DM'ed me and apologized
    for the mix-up. He wasn't sure how it happened and assured me it was nothing personal.\r\n\r\nBy
    all means go ahead an post/link this. It'd be my pleasure. Just send me the link
    if you could. Thanks!\r\n\r\n:)"

  content: I just discovered that I have been blocked by Don today. I have bee a loyal
    fan and read all of his books, enjoyed his DVD on Into The Elements, and I am
    really disappointed and hurt. I have no idea how I offended him. I agree and appreciate
    many of his insights and share with my friends and family, and now I'm blocked!
    I'd like to think my case too was unintentional, but I made a couple of comments
    to his TweetPic prior to me being removed. I didn't think those comments were
    that annoying, but I really don't know. I am just shocked right now.

    I make no promises, though. I don't have that much pull.

  content: "Here's the conversation I just had with him... not sure it's helpful at
    all :-P\r\n\r\n<strong>Me</strong>: Don, somebody contacted me saying that you
    had blocked them on Twitter. Would you consider unblocking them? Thanks! @modkoko\r\n\r\n<strong>Don</strong>:
    I only block people who are insulting or offended. I don't want to give them any
    more offense. That name is not familiar. But why allow people to see tweets when
    they are only going to use them against me? Sorry.\r\n\r\n<strong>Me</strong>:
    To clarify on that last DM, they are blocked for a reason? If so, I will relay
    the message. Thanks for the response.\r\n\r\n<strong>Don</strong>: I have no idea.
    Never heard the name\r\n\r\nJust to make sure... are you blocked from following
    @donmilleris? Or did you perhaps accidentally try to follow the wrong Don?"

  content: "Hmm. I don't understand why he blocked me. Yes, I have been blocked from
    the right Don. I know because I have been following him and even received DM from
    him once about his new book coming out. (He followed me just a second so that
    he could send me a DM) Then recently all of a sudden his tweets stop showing up,
    so I realized something happened.\r\n\r\nI have been a big fan of all of his books
    and never said anything against him. I have always shared positive things about
    his books and his views to my friends and family. My twitter ID is Modkoko but
    the profile also shows name Ministry of Design (as well my icon). I don't know
    if he recall that name? Either way, I never said anything bad or offensive to
    him. If he's not willing to let me follow him, I am not going to force him, even
    though I believe it is done unfairly. I am just really shocked and hurt because
    I have no idea what resulted in me being blocked from someone I adore, but I won't
    force my way to follow someone if he's not willing to see about what happened.
    If he doesn't recall my name but not willing to unblock me, I just leave it alone.
    I thought Don will at least look into it, but I know he's very busy and understand
    that he doesn't have time for this kind of thing. I can still see his blogs on
    his website, and read his books. I won't stop being a fan because he is a great
    author and I still admire his works. But thank you so much for trying. I really
    appreciate it."

<p>Dear Donald Miller,</p>
<p>First of all, allow me to introduce myself to you... possibly for a second time. My name is Greg Loesch, and I'm currently a student at the Ohio State University. I'm a fellow believer and follower of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Without meaning to tempt you into prideful thoughts, I'd like to tell you that I thoroughly enjoy your books - particularly <em>Through Painted Deserts</em><em>. </em>I also read your blog occasionally and heard you speak when you campaigned for Obama this past fall. I actually even shook your hand before you autographed one of my books as I commented on an email you had written to Obama discussing your trip to Starbucks in which you tried to fill your Nalgene bottle with frappuccino. So... moving on to the main point of this letter.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-409"></a></p>
<p>It came to my attention the other day that I am currently blocked from following you on Twitter. <strong>My Twitter user name is @compulsiveguile, and I respectively ask that you unblock me</strong>. You have some insightful thoughts, and I would like to be kept up-to-date on things such as your book progress, etc. I hope that you didn't receive too many "tweets" from people that started with "LUCY!", and I doubt you did, as my blog doesn't have that large of a following. If you didn't guess, that was my (lame) attempt at getting your attention. If you're reading this, I guess it worked (and am amazed at the power of social networking).</p>
<p>I apologize if I have done anything that may have offended you or possibly caused you some great annoyance. If so, I just ask that you let me know what I've done. A response in typical Twitter fashion would be acceptable (140 characters or less). However, if you blocked me because you're upset that my blog is better than yours or because I'm a better writer than you, I rescind my apology and replace it with a mother-like lecture about pride.</p>
<p>I'd like to read your books without thinking "Hey, this guy is an awesome writer!... but he blocked me on Twitter... despite having over 15,000 followers." If I can be of any assistance helping you figure out the fastest way to unblock me, by all means let me know. You can leave a comment or email me at gloesch.web[at]gmail.com.</p>
<p>I appreciate you taking the time to read this.</p>
<p>Sincerely in Christ,</p>
<p>Greg Loesch</p>
