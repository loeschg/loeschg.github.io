<p>Yesterday, Microsoft announced price cuts on the Home Premium and Ultimate versions of Vista. According to WIRED's <a href="http://news.wired.com/dynamic/stories/M/MICROSOFT_VISTA_PRICE_CUT?SITE=WIRE&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2008-02-29-10-44-33" title="WIRED - MS cuts price">article</a> (read all about it here), "price cuts will range from 20 percent to 48 percent." This is only for retail versions (obviously), not for systems that come with it previously installed. I'm not sure whether to look at this as another desperate attempt to attract buyers to Vista, a publicity stunt for Vista Service Pack 1, or something else. Regardless, the results should be interesting.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-79"></a></p>
<p>It seems somewhat odd that Microsoft is offering such a price cut on a product that was released hardly a year ago. Granted these past few OS upgrades (Tiger to Leopard and XP to Vista) are the only ones I've ever really paid attention to, Microsoft's actions seem a bit like an abnormality.</p>
<p>I guess if I hadn't read this article, I wouldn't have known that Service Pack 1 was being released this month... that counts for something, right? I'll definitely be reading into what the consensus is regarding the update. I'd like to think that all Vista user's problems will be solved by this Service Pack update, but it just doesn't seem likely. Here's why:</p>
<p><a href="http://apcmag.com/8344/has_vista_lost_all_credibility" title="has_vista_lost_all_credibility?">Reason 1</a>: Vista was apparently released with relatively low standards for proper performance. Recent news is revealing several disagreements among Microsoft's head officials as to the set "standard" that makes a computer "Vista compatible/friendly." I have my doubts that a Service Pack update would make up for power/hardware insufficiencies. Walt Mossberg covers some other reasons <a href="http://ptech.allthingsd.com/20080214/big-update-for-vista-leaves-little-changed-for-mainstream-users/" title="Mossberg - Vista">here</a>.</p>
<p>Reason 2: While I can't find the article that I was going to put here, I can explain briefly what it was about. Basically third party software developers were expressing concern with Microsoft not presenting them with Service Pack 1 in order to address software compatibility. Either Microsoft's confident everything will still work or... I don't know. It seems like the compatibility issues were just kind of getting sorted out from the XP to Vista jump. Let's hope, for the sake of all Windows users' sanity, that they don't have to struggle through more incompatibility problems.</p>
<p>Google "Vista Service Pack 1" and see what you come up with yourself. It's just not looking terribly promising for Vista users.</p>
<p>Until next time...</p>
