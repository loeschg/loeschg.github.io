<p><font size="2">Starting... my junior year in HS<a id="more"></a><a id="more-10"></a>, I believe, I made my 1st lame attempt to jump into Linux. I had all these big aspirations to become a Linux master, impress all of my friends, and then not go to college because some company wanted my services. I would then steadily climb up the corporate ladder and become a multi-million dollar man by the age of... 25-30. Plausible, right? Okay, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a big exaggeration, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what most good stories consist of, right? Realistically, yeah I hoped I would become somewhat proficient with Linux without the need of a GUI (Graphical User Interface). The easiest way to explain this is to say itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like using MS-DOS opposed to Windows (as much as many might hate to read that example). I was hoping to master the command/text based world in a matter of months. Ha ha... rrrrrrright. By the way, I was going to do this without books or classes. All I needed was my intuition and Google. *insert insulting laugh here* Yeah, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a reason why all those Ã¢â‚¬Å“UnixÃ¢â‚¬Â jokes exist. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">I have never been more frustrated working with a computer in my life than working with Unix/Linux. Granted this really wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t technically speaking a pure Unix issue, it was more than enough to add to my growing vendetta against Unix/Linux. Understand how hard this is for me to admit, being a guy that considers himself computer savvy. To explain my problem in brief, I was simply trying to figure out an easier way to upload my website which is created with iWeb, and I ran into a whole slew of problems which I have yet to solve. Rsync will undoubtedly be the death of me. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">If you create a website using iWeb and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a .Mac account from Apple, uploading to a third-party site is a pain in the buttutey. Every time you export your files to a folder from iWeb, every file is rewritten, making selective uploading more difficult than it should be. You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t elect to upload only the files that have been changed because EVERY ONE OF THEM GETS CHANGED WHEN YOU PUBLISH TO A FOLDER! Creating normal web sites in which you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t upload often is simple in iWeb, but it gets to be quite irritating if you attempt to blog or make frequent updates without the .Mac account. You who have dabbled in this area can share my frustration IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Hard to justify .Mac over a webhost such as netfirms for web basics...</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Before I say all this, know that I am a big advocate of Apple and most of its products. They have a way of creating their products that makes them sleek and sexy which, in turn, makes you feel the same way. Seamless integration is supposed to be (and usually is) one of their big design features that puts them a point up over Microsoft. However a lot of the time itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re integrating another Mac product... My case and point: iWeb. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re sticking with Apple, and you buy a .Mac account, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re golden. However, you want to upload to a third-party site which costs about $80 less while offering 10x the storage compared to .Mac? Too bad. How hard would it have been for iWeb to incorporate/engineer some easier publishing method for those of us who lack the funds/arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t interested in .Mac accounts? There may be some technical issues that make this harder than I think to program but honestly, come on Apple. Seems to be yet another case of corporate greed. *Sigh* and we were ignorant enough to think Apple was above that.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Until next time... </font></p>
