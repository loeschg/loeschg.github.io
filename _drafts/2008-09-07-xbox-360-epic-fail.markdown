  Yes, I am posting another article regarding Microsoft's shortcomings. I, by no means, want to become a Microsoft hating blogger who only posts things regarding Microsoft's stupidity, but I just can't help sharing some of the articles I come across on the internet. Let's face it. At times, <a title="Microsoft sucks" href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/technology/article1529988.ece" target="_blank">Microsoft just plain sucks</a>.
  <p style="text-align: left;">One of the recent popular topics on <a title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> was in regard to the Xbox 360, and its seemingly never-ending number of defects and technical failures. As most of you know, there have been loads and loads of Xbox 360's that, once sold, have made the long trip back to Microsoft's repair center or defective warehouse (which must be close to the size of a small planet) due to the "epic" Red Ring of Death (see picture below) or some other hardware failure. I mean, COME ON! A WIKIPEDIA ENTRY IS DEDICATED TO THE <a title="Wiki - Xbox 360 technical problems" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems" target="_blank">XBOX 360's TECHNICAL PROBLEMS</a>!!! I won't explain all the statistics or stories of the Xbox 360's defects and shortcoming... they're explained perfectly fine in this article - <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5046314/the-shocking-inside-story-of-the-epic-defects-that-killed-millions-of-xbox-360s">Xbox 360: The Shocking Inside Story of the Epic Defects That Killed Millions of Xbox 360s</a>.</p>

<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-198"></a>But seriously think about it. How many people do you know that had to ship back Nintendo 64's because of some defect? How about Playstation 2's? Playstation 3's? How about Wiis? Okay... Nintendo did have to ship out beefier straps and protective covers (dubbed "Wiimote Condoms" - They keep everyone safe) for free because of the strange innate desire of the Wiimotes to destroy nice TV's. I know of at least 2 people without even thinking much about it that have had to send in their Xbox 360's for repairs. Heck, my cousin's stopped working again (had it repaired once). It's out of warranty, and he figures it's probably better for his sanity to just buy a new one. I guess he trusts Microsoft has fixed everything...</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Eh, just a little rant. I don't even own a 360 (I'm a Wii enthusiast... with no broken tv's), and the whole ordeal makes me mad. Yes, I know nothing about running a multi billion dollar business. I should probably give Microsoft a little slack, but I'm not going to. I can't help but feel like they need to do something... fast... that will put a look of wonder on our faces. Sure, Microsoft's not going anywhere, but it's fascinating watching their possible demise building (which might be worth dedicating a post to...). To finish this all off, I'm going to give you a link to their latest "<a title="Gates &amp; Seinfeild &amp; Microsoft = Fail" href="http://greg-loesch.com/blog/youtube-gates-seinfeld-commercial/" target="_self">epic failure</a>."</p>
