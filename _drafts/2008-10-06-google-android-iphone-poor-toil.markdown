<p style="text-align: left;">Two days ago, the first <a title="Android - Google" href="http://code.google.com/android/" target="_blank">Android</a>-equipped phone was demonstrated, and the internet has been all a-buzz with the latest and greatest information regarding Android. For those of you who have not heard of this strange name (no, I'm not talking about the bad guys in the game StarFox), it's the name of Google's cell phone operating system/software platform.</p>

<p>On September 23rd, the world got its first real glimpse of Android at work as T-Mobile released the <a title="Google Android" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile_G1" target="_blank">HTC Dream</a> (HTC G1) for pre-order (it's supposed to be available in Oct '08). Equipped with a touch screen and physical keyboard, the HTC Dream was/is predicted to give the iPhone a run for its money. It contains plenty of features that the iPhone lacks (better camera, physical keyboard, Wi-Fi 802.11g, copy-and-pasting abilities, removeable battery, multi-application support, and it's pretty much open-source), but it also lacks some of the features that the iPhone has (such as the multi-touch features, developed app store, and other features that come from being in production for some time).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU2PwjRWUdE[/youtube]</p>
<p>I can't help but feel that iPhone sales will do just fine with the release of the HTC Dream. I mean come on! It's Apple! I think we can all agree that Apple products just have this... irresistible charm. The gadgets are sleek, functional, and cause many of us to drool. The interface is intuitive, and the gadget response is simply enjoyable. Let's compare a simple feature that many of the touch phones have: the simple "slide-to-unlock" screen.Ã‚Â  If you've tried these out yourself, I think I'm pretty safe in saying that none feel quite the same as the iPhone. But enough of me explaining my lust for the iPhone...</p>
<p>The release of Android on this new T-Mobile phone has caused a great deal of unrest in my life (slightly exaggerated... <em>slightly</em>). Let me explain. This past year or so I have spent hours upon hours tinkering with settings, trying out applications, and getting my workflow setup just the way I want. Now that I'm starting to get pretty settled, the tinkering has started to wane... which leaves me with a desire to tinker with something else. Now that the first Android phone is being released, I now am forced to directly address my great stressful desire for a new gadget (not to mention the updated iPhone and Apple's iPod unveilings earlier this month).</p>
<p>The three gadgets that I want most right now are the iPhone, the HTC Dream, and/or the iPod Touch. All of which are out of the picture due mainly to a lack of funds.Ã‚Â  I want the biggest iPod Touch (I already have 30 GB of music), but it's tough spending $400 on a handheld device that doesn't even make calls. The iPhone and HTC Dream are out of the question because of the stupid cell-phone service providers (and also $$$). I long for the day the iPhone is compatible - without hacking - with Verizon's network. Also, do I need to even mention the danger the Apple App Store poses to my bank account?</p>
<p>Well... that's enough of the ranting. I am curious though. How do all you "poor-gadget-lovers" tolerate all these new handheld tech announcements? I can't be alone... can I?</p>
