  - Mac app that automatically fetches and embeds lyrics in iTunes - couldn't find
  the lyrics for the song. This happens occasionally, so I quickly Googled (and even
  \"<a title=\"Bing - Microsoft Search Engine\" href=\"http://www.bing.com/\">Bing</a>\"ed
  - will that ever catch?) for \"Jars of Clay Prisoner of Hope lyrics.\" Nothing.\r\n\r\nI
  found myself in a similar situation not too long ago with the song <a title=\"Greg
  Loesch - Jars of Clay Closer\" href=\"http://greg-loesch.com/blog/107/jars-of-clay-closer/\">Closer</a>
  from the same album, and my solution was to do the work myself.Â  Sure enough, that's
  what I did for Prisoner of Hope. In case any of you Jars fans are interested, here
  are the lyrics.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small\" title=\"Jars of Clay

<p style="text-align: left;">Jars of Clay - Prisoner of Hope<br />
(Closer EP)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Stay close to me<br />
In the shadow of my wing<br />
In the shadow of my wing</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Though the waters taste of poison<br />
The wounds are all you feel<br />
There is singing all around you<br />
And the promises are real</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hide your face<br />
Let the wind run out of breath<br />
Let the wind run out of breath</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Make you bleed from the heart<br />
And ache from the mind<br />
The Saints are singing in your funerals<br />
Strength for you to find</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Prisoner of Hope, it won't be long now<br />
Prisoner of Hope, you can be strong now</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Fall into me<br />
I'll turn your ashes into flames<br />
I'll turn your ashes into flames</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Prisoner of Hope, it won't be long now<br />
Prisoner of Hope, you can be strong now</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Prisoner, I hope you carry on now<br />
Prisoner, your love it can't be held down</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Prisoner of Hope, it won't be long now<br />
Prisoner, I hope, you can be strong now</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Prisoner of Hope, you carry on now<br />
Prisoner, your love it can't be held down</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">(Prisoner of Hope) Can't be held down<br />
(Prisoner of Hope) Can't be held down<br />
(Prisoner of Hope) Can't be held down</p>
