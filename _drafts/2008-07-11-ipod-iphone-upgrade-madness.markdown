<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="iPhone comic" rel="lightbox[pics117]" href="http://greg-loesch.com/blog/blog.pics/2008/07/iphone-comic.gif"><img class="attachment wp-att-118 centered" src="http://greg-loesch.com/blog/blog.pics/2008/07/iphone-comic.thumbnail.gif" alt="" width="162" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>So I just read this article (<a title="Apple releases iPhone and iPod touch software 2.0 " href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/07/11/apple_releases_iphone_and_ipod_touch_software_2_0_see_warning.html" target="_blank">Apple releases iPhone and iPod touch software 2.0</a>) at AppleInsider.com. I am a little surprised at Apple's apparent lack of preparation. I, however, can't help but wish I was a part of this frustrating madness. I want an iPhone (I'd also settle for an iPod Touch) so bad! I don't have the funds to buy and continue to operate an iPhone. I think my iPod Video is about crapped out, so as soon as an iPod Touch upgrade occurs, I'm off to Best Buy with my 3 year warranty and list of problems in hand.</p>
