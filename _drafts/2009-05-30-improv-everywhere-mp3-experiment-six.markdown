  just read an interesting article by David Pogue in which he described one of Improv
  Everywhere's recent events. For those of you who are not familiar with this group,
  I'll attempt to explain to the best of my knowledge. This group coordinates various
  \"missions\" or \"stunts\" often times in which a large body of people perform actions
  simultaneously in public. The goal is to simply have fun apparently. To give you
  an idea, check out this <a href=\"http://greg-loesch.com/blog/56/frozen-in-ny-youtube/\">post
  and youtube video</a>. Pretty awesome, eh?\r\n\r\n"

<p>I just read an interesting article by David Pogue in which he described one of Improv Everywhere's recent events. For those of you who are not familiar with this group, I'll attempt to explain to the best of my knowledge. This group coordinates various "missions" or "stunts" often times in which a large body of people perform actions simultaneously in public. The goal is to simply have fun apparently.

<p>The most recent Improv Everywhere event was called <a title="Improv Everywhere" href="http://improveverywhere.com">Mp3 Experiment Six</a>. It involved thousands of people syncing their watches, putting on two shirts, flocking to a particular spot in New York, and hitting the play button on their iPods to listen to an mp3 they had downloaded previously but never listened to... all at the exact same time. You can read more about it <a title="David Pogue - mp3 Experiment" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/28/technology/personaltech/28pogue-email.html">here</a>. The YouTube video of this event should show up relatively soon. I'm looking forward to it.</p>
<p>I'm way far away from all of these events that take place in good ol' NY, but I hope to maybe participate in something that's as ridiculously absurd yet strikingly fascinating.</p>
