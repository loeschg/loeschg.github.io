IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure subconsciously I was hoping <a id="more"></a><a id="more-26"></a>itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d give me Ã¢â‚¬Å“JesusÃ¢â‚¬Â power to Ã¢â‚¬Å“saveÃ¢â‚¬Â everyone around me in school, if you know what I mean. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interesting how my mind can turn Ã¢â‚¬Å“sharing GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s loveÃ¢â‚¬Â into a project. People turn into Ã¢â‚¬Å“spiritualÃ¢â‚¬Â projects opposed to people. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wrong.</p>

<p class="paragraph_style">The book is one of the easiest books to read, and I mean that in more of a sense than the thinness and big text. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s emotionally stimulating, and for me, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all it takes. Is that why people read books? You read some books to gain knowledge, and the rest of the books, you read to get the pyscho-emotional chemicals flowing. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life in the book world.</p>

<p>The chapter I just read did just that. It wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t overwhelmingly insightful or anything like that; it just made me ponder something for a bit. It was the chapter titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Alone - Fifty-three Years in Space.Ã¢â‚¬Â At the end of the chapter, Donald Miller writes about community and its tie-ins with followers of Christ.</p>

<h3>Ã¢â‚¬Å“... I should have people around buggin me and getting under my skin because without people I could not grow - I could not grow in God, and I could not grow as a human.Ã¢â‚¬Â</h3>

<p class="paragraph_style">I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fully relate to him, as I consider him to be more introverted than myself, but I can definitely understand what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s saying. If I was given a choice of living alone or with somebody else, I would always choose alone (unless weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re talking about my bride-to-be, whoever that may be... if anyone). I can be easily irritated by insignificant actions of those who live with or around me, and I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to deal with it... and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wrong. Simple as that.</p>

<p class="paragraph_style">Living in a dorm room the size of an average microwave with another person has proved to be somewhat challenging (Marvin if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re reading this, I mean no offense. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a character-flaw on my end). I suppose it is true that these experiences do build character. If nothing else, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a more flexible person. My roommate likes to stay up late, and I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exactly. He leaves the room to study late, I leave a light on for him, put in purple ear-plugs, and have one of those sleeping masks (itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not purple) so I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wake up when he comes in. Yes, I am a light sleeper, and yes, that has potential to be a funny visual. Stupid example, I know, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all I can come up with. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to say what effect living with and around people who are different and have different beliefs has on me, but my gut tells me itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s making me who I am and who IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m meant to be.</p>
