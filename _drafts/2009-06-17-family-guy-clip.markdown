<p style="text-align: left;">Note: This is a "redo" of a previous post I had. I posted this video on YouTube, got close to a thousand views in a few days, then received a copyright notification from Fox. I don't think they'll complain if I post it here. If so, down she'll go, like Stewie and Brian in the raft.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So for the last year or so, I didn't watch Family Guy at any level of regularity, mainly because of the lack of DVR. I watched pretty much every season about 2 years ago, and I was borderline obsessed with it. However, with time, I'd grown tired of the mediocre plots, similar humor, and the... obscure randomness. I'd moved on to much more distinguished shows like Arrested Development and the Office :smile:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now that I'm in a house at school with guys willing to pay for DVR, I've started watching a bit more than I had been. I sat down to watch the "<a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/39782/family-guy-road-to-germany" target="_blank">Road to Germany</a>" episode with some of the guys the other night, and while most of it was nothing exceptional, Stewie had a quote that made me laugh for about several minutes straight. I hadn't laughed that hard at a TV show/movie for I don't know how long.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Check out the link to the video I uploaded below. The quote is right around the 15 second mark. I seriously think it's the funniest part I've ever seen in Family Guy.</p>
