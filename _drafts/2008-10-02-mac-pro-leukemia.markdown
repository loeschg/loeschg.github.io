    a month now.\r\n\r\nYou know quite a bit more than I do about guitar... so I'm
    hoping to learn some stuff.\r\n\r\n :smile:"

<p>One of the latest stories buzzing around on the internet is the story of some French guy claiming that Mac Pros give you leukemia. It has something to do with the odor and some toxin that gives you cancer. Interesting. I'm getting a headache thinking about it. I own a MacBOOK Pro... phew!</p>
<p>This is an article from CrunchGear with a bit more info/insight on the whole dealio.</p>
<p>My favorite quote:</p>
<blockquote><p><span>While we would love to give Apple the green light on this, what company would openly admit that they products could literally kill you?</span></p></blockquote>
<p>That's indeed a good question...</p>
