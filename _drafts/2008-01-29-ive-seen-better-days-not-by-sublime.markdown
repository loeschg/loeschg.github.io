excerpt: "Sorry for the repeated negative posts, but I can't hold myself back from
  this one. This is about my wonderful *yes, that's sarcasm* day that I got to experience.
  I had a pretty good day yesterday, and I was optimistic looking ahead to the week.
  Then today happened.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"/blog///mnt/w0506/d12/s06/b02ce878/www/greg-loesch.com//blog//blog.pics/2008/01/angry.jpg\"

  I felt somewhat awake and alert in my 8 AM Java programming class, and I had a sub
  professor that was... pretty funny. He cracked jokes pretty much the entire time...
  a lot of the jokes being suited for elementary students. I laughed a lot, I'm not
  going to lie. Well, I find out during this class period that my class is canceled
  for next Thursday. That's awesome because that's an 8 AM class. Yes, the day looked
  to be progressing well...\r\n\r\n"

  content: Ouch!  That is nuts!  All I gotta say is thank goodness for Time Machine.  But
    that doesn't help your Bose.  Good luck on the warranty and let us know.

    didn't see my blog entry following this one. Appreciate the concern."

<p>I meandered my way back to the dorm (stopped a couple places to take care of some paperwork/billing stuff) enjoying the out-of-the-ordinary warm weather. I got back, grabbed some breakfast with a friend, and headed back to the dorm to await my next class. I fiddled around on my computer, messing with Vector Designer, a sweet new program I just got in the MacHeist bundle (see two posts ago). It won best of show at the MacWorld 08 conference or something of that sort. Anyways, the time rolls around and off I went to Engineering class.</p>
<p>Class went well, not terribly interesting, and we're out 15 minutes early. Not the greatest thing ever since I had class right after... which meant I had to find a way to kill time. Hey, it's better than going over, right? So off to Physics I trek. Class started and there's rumor of class being canceled on Thursday. Sure enough, the prof confirms it. *SCORE!* that means one class on Thursday! Yup, life is still good.</p>
<p>Back to the dorm I went. This is where the ball gets rolling... I got back after getting my stamp to mail my traffic ticket fine (yeah, it's a lot of $$) and start fiddling on my computer again. I'm messing with my Stacks in Leopard and other Finder options... which involves moving folders around. A bad idea if things aren't backed up. Long story short, I end up deleting what I THOUGHT to be an 'alias'. Yeah... it was the actual folder, and yeah... I did get overambitious and empty the trashcan. I instantly see one of my Stack's icons go to a big '?' *insert cursing here*</p>
<p>I sat there in disbelief for a few seconds, trying to comprehend the damage. I think for a second it might be okay until I realize that my *stinkin* programming assignment that I had worked on for over 3+ hours was in that folder. Hours slaving away at the computer into the garbage... and away to the landfill... where it got burned. I tried downloading various Recovery programs to recover the file but to no avail.</p>
<p>I weighed my options and decided I'd let my head clear. I head to my prof's office hours for some Differential Equations help. Needless to say, I wasn't thinking much clearer after that. I went back to the dorm and checked the results of my drive scans. Of course I would be able to find files I deleted months ago but not the one I had deleted LESS THAN 45 MINUTES AGO!!! I don't understand quite how that works...</p>
<p>I tinker around desperately for a few more minutes and accept defeat. I move on, and I head over to the church (dropping my speeding fine off to be mailed), where I volunteer at an after-school program for kids. It's usually pretty crazy, but I felt... manipulated by the kids more so than usual. I got kicked in the *yeah*, slapped in the head multiple times with a book, and got screamed at by various kids. The time passed relatively quickly, and I headed back to the dorm, dreading reprogramming my project. Yeah, it gets even better...</p>
<p>I walk into my room, sit down at my computer, get things situated, and I start my project... from scratch. I'm obviously not in a good mood when my roommate so graciously informs me that he unplugged my speakers (... okay? Why would you do that?). He then goes on to explain that he walked into our room and my speakers were buzzing despite being muted. I figure he's crazy and doesn't know what he's talking about, but sure enough, my Bose sound system no longer seems to be working. I can't get a chirp from it aside from the awful buzzing. I thought I might die. I mustered up some strength and carried on.</p>
<p>Things got a little better from there, but I'm still mildly upset. I got an encouraging text from a friend, got the project finished, and ate some food while watching the Office.</p>
<p>Ah... again I state that life goes on. All I have to say is that those speakers better be under warranty...</p>
