  recently released their new single \"Closer.\" I was looking for the lyrics online,
  and I couldn't find anything, so I figured why not just post them myself? I'm sure
  I'm violating some copyright law, but until I'm informed directly, I'll leave the
  lyrics up.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">"

<p style="text-align: left;">Jars of Clay, a band favorite of mine, just recently released their new single "Closer." I was looking for the lyrics online, and I couldn't find anything, so I figured why not just post them myself? I'm sure I'm violating some copyright law, but until I'm informed directly, I'll leave the lyrics up.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a id="more"></a><a id="more-107"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The lyrics for "Closer" are not at all the norm for Jars of Clay, but I like 'em. The songs and lyrics are catchy. This is not 100% accurate (notice the question marks in the lyrics), so if you have any corrections, let me know, and I'll be glad to get this updated. Until next time...</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Closer<br />
-by Jars of Clay</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Well you thought you let go<br />
but you're still hanging on<br />
Mother Earth slowing down<br />
she's still spinning around<br />
and we... are getting dizzy...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I'll drop out of the race<br />
for more personal space<br />
Cos the rockets we're in<br />
get so cold, and I miss your skin<br />
It's just how I'm feeling</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">If you need more love well you've got to get close to me<br />
If you want my love well you've got to get closer to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">No unreachable itch,<br />
If you hemorrhage IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll stitch<br />
You are tears, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a cheek.<br />
I'm a pail on your boat with slow leaks<br />
Out to sea for weeks</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">If you want my love well you've got to get close to me<br />
If you need my love well you've got to get closer to me<br />
Oooo if you want my love</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I don't understand why we can't get close enough<br />
I want your kite strings tangled in my trees all wrapped up<br />
Well, I don't understand why we can't get close enough<br />
I'll be the comets that are falling from the sky you light up (light up)(?)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You're my shirt iron on. I'm the tick, You're the bomb<br />
You're the 'L' and the 'V,' I'm the 'O' and the 'E'<br />
Am I speaking clearly?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">If you want my love well you've got to get close to me.<br />
Oooo, if you want my love</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I don't understand why we can't get close enough<br />
I want your kite strings tangled in my trees all wrapped up<br />
Well, I don't understand why we can't get close enough<br />
I'll be the comets that are falling from the sky you light up</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Cos I don't understand why we can't get close enough<br />
I miss the shivers in my spine every time that we touch</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Thanks to trigger, Nathan, &amp; thetamind for corrections</em></p>
