  the past... couple weeks or so, I made the switch from Firefox to Safari due to
  a couple different factors. Whether or not I want to admit it, I think the 'outdated'
  look of Firefox 2 was a large factor. With the release of Leopard, it seems that
  every Mac application has undergone aesthetic changes (though perhaps I'm just noticing
  it more now) to match the new OS's GUI. Firefox's interface just stuck out like
  a sore thumb (that's a funny phrase if you think about it... does a sore thumb really
  stick out? Moving on...), and I just couldn't handle it. That coupled with the continuous
  Safari tips that have been posted in various Mac Tips sites drove me to make the
  switch.\r\n\r\nUpon making the switch, I found that Safari proved to load quite
  a bit faster than Firefox 2. While the actual time differential's pretty minute,
  it made me feel as though my MacBook was snappier. I had to make a few minor adjustments
  (no bookmark sidebar :(, a lack of plug-ins, etc.), but overall I was pleased. It
  just felt... right."

  content: "Wow, that does look sweet!  One question: what is that little key icon
    on your Safari browser?  I haven't seen that, and it doesn't pull up when I go
    to customize the toolbar.\r\n\r\nReasons I like Safari over others:\r\n1) When
    I click the maximize button, it expands to frame the website, not the entire widescreen
    computer.\r\n2) shift+command+i = superfast email of links.\r\n3) syncs bookmarks
    with iphone\r\n4) saves history of web pages, and they pull up in a search along
    with bookmarks.\r\n5) minimalist design (as is Apple's wont).  \r\n6) I like the
    RSS feeds better in Safari than other browsers.\r\n\r\nBut I'm always tempted
    with Firefox's add ons."

  content: "The key is an added icon that comes from the program 1Password. I got
    it with the MacHeist bundle. It organizes and protects all your online passwords,
    forms, and credit card(s) if you want with one master password. With a quick keyboard
    shortcut, it fills in everything for you. I prefer it over saving it directly
    in Safari/Firefox.\r\n\r\nIf you're willing to shell out a couple bucks, I think
    it's well worth it. One of my favorite apps from the bundle. \r\n\r\nI definitely
    agree with you in regard to resize option and RSS feeds. Firefox isn't very RSS
    friendly I don't think. There are plug-ins I'm pretty sure that add more functionality;
    I've just never looked into them. I use Mac Mail for my feeds. I don't have an
    iPhone :-(, so the sync feature means nothing to me. Someday though..."

<p>Within the past... couple weeks or so, I made the switch from Firefox to Safari due to a couple different factors. Whether or not I want to admit it, I think the 'outdated' look of Firefox 2 was a large factor. With the release of Leopard, it seems that every Mac application has undergone aesthetic changes (though perhaps I'm just noticing it more now) to match the new OS's GUI.

That coupled with the continuous Safari tips that have been posted in various Mac Tips sites drove me to make the switch.</p>
<p>Upon making the switch, I found that Safari proved to load quite a bit faster than Firefox 2. While the actual time differential's pretty minute, it made me feel as though my MacBook was snappier.

<p>All was well in Greg's tech-world until I attempted to add an entry to my blog. Wordpress' built-in editor did not - and still does not - play nice with Safari. Opposed to seeing all the buttons/toggles that I'm supposed to see, I saw dreadful little question marks all in a cute little BLASTED row. I tried posting a different way (typed my post in NVU, then did that whole copy-&gt;paste number), but it just caused more problems that I was not willing to deal with. I thought I might just switch between Firefox and Safari depending on what my agenda called for (they're both free, so why not?), but I found the switching to hinder my workflow. Yes, I like to pretend I do productive things on my 'Book.</p>
<p>Tonight, I decided I'd give Firefox 3.0 (Beta 3) a shot. I couldn't get something to work, thus I immediately shifted the blame to Safari. I decided enough was enough and downloaded the new version. If anyone's keeping score, it didn't work in Firefox either. Regardless, I'm extremely happy I tried the new Firefox out. Granted I've been using it for only a few hours... I think I'm sticking with it.</p>
<p>The new interface looks AWESOME! Very sleek I must say. Yes... it does look awfully similar to Safari, but it's more versatile in my opinion. Until Safari makes a true cross-platform shift, I'm sticking with the Fire. For those of you interested, here's a comparison of the two (click the pictures for larger images).</p>
