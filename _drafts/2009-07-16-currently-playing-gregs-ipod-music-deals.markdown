  I linked above is essentially a free two week trial in which you get a free 25 downlaods.
  Â You can, in all honesty, sign up, grab your free 25 songs, and get the heck out
  of there without paying a cent. You just have to make sure you cancel within 2 weeks,
  and the cancellation is as simple as clicking a link. It was refreshing to see.

  to get you to buy anything. I have no incentive like referrals."

<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Artist --- Album</em></p>
<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; text-align: center;"><a title="iTunes - Owl City" href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=323239164&amp;s=143441">Owl City---Fireflies-Single</a> (iTunes link)</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2508/3728203850_2178c41217_m.jpg" alt="Owl City" width="234" height="179" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">---This single is currently a free download on iTunes. Owl City's albums will definitely find themselves in my music library soon. It's like Mae/Death Cab meets techno/electronica. Quality stuff. It has potential to clear some room in my top 5 favorite artists, though it's still early in the game.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00160IM08/ref=sr_1_artist_1_rd?ie=UTF8&amp;parent=B002EAP0L8&amp;qid=1247791882&amp;sr=1-1">Discovery---LP</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3157/3727404425_3bb6e00557_m.jpg" alt="Discovery LP" width="234" height="179" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">---This is the child of Vampire Weekend and Ra Ra Riot. Somewhat of a side-project, I guess. I don't highly recommend buying the whole album... definitely some quality songs though. Check out Osaka Loop Line and I Want You Back. This is a little different from my normal music tastes. Pretty "heavy" techno beats with an R&amp;B flair with the auto-tune in portions. Purchased via Amazon mp3 on sale. It can be found on eMusic.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=266711503&amp;s=143441">Manchester Orchestra---You Brainstorm, I Brainstorm. But Brilliance Needs A Good Editor [EP]</a> (iTunes link)</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Manchester Orchestra" href="http://greg-loesch.com/blog/flickr/photo/3728203990/manchester-orchestra.html"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2435/3728203990_983429f5de_m.jpg" alt="Manchester Orchestra" width="234" height="179" /></a><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Jamie Cullum" href="http://greg-loesch.com/blog/flickr/photo/3727404373/jamie-cullum.html"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Jamie Cullum" href="http://greg-loesch.com/blog/flickr/photo/3727404373/jamie-cullum.html"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">---I was recently exposed to Manchester Orchestra by my friend<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">s</span> Sam (<a title="Twitter - Sam Schoutko" href="http://twitter.com/wasilly">@Wasilly</a>) <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and Maples</span> (Sorry Mapes... Sam wants all the credit). This was the only album/EP that was available at eMusic. I'm a fan. Light Alternative (Death Cab-esque).</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hope-For-The-Hopeless/dp/B001IDGLLK/ref=dm_cd_album_lnk?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1247792064&amp;sr=1-1">Brett Dennen---Hope for the Hopeless</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3453/3727404529_4819376181_m.jpg" alt="Brett Dennen" width="234" height="179" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">---This guy is a pretty solid musician. His vocal tone is peculiar which makes me like him, and he's got a groovin' pop/rock sound. It's the kind of music you might snap your fingers to. He actually opened for a <a title="John Mayer - Set List 2008" href="http://greg-loesch.com/blog/123/john-mayer-blossom/">John Mayer concert I went to</a>... but I missed him because my idiot friends wanted to make a Chipotle run. *sigh* Definitely check out the song "Make You Crazy." Purchased on eMusic.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/For-Emma-Forever-Ago/dp/B0013IKUIK/ref=sr_shvl_album_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1247792092&amp;sr=301-2">Bon Iver---For Emma, Forever Ago</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2603/3727404579_79ff2cbb77_m.jpg" alt="Bon Iver" width="234" height="179" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">---This is music that will grow on you. It's really chill. The vocals may initially be a bit of a turn-off, but it gets better with time. Bon Iver's imperfections make them perfect. Very soothing and melodic. Excellent sleep time music. Purchased on eMusic.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_dmusic?url=search-alias%3Ddigital-music&amp;field-keywords=jamie+cullum+grace+is+gone&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">Jamie Cullum---Grace is Gone (Soundtrack)</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3425/3727404373_b0082b6dda_m.jpg" alt="Jamie Cullum" width="234" height="179" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">---I didn't buy this whole soundtrack (Clint Eastwood actually wrote the score... which is pretty awesome, but I held back), just the song Grace is Gone by Jamie Cullum. The movie was slow yet emotionally stimulating, and this song fits pretty well. Jamie's voice and piano talents get me every time in this ballad. Play this on piano for a girl, and she'll automatically be yours. Stamp the Greg Loesch Guarantee on that one. Purchased on iTunes (the song can be... not the Greg Loesch Guarantee).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">

<p style="text-align: left;">---I really haven't taken a good long listen to this, in all honesty, but I liked what my ears have heard thus far. This is probably old news to most of you, I'm sure, as it was a 2006 release. Pretty solid album all around. Purchased this on Amazon (bought the CD for like $7 or something like that).</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Summer-Love-Songs/dp/B0029EBFJU/ref=sr_shvl_album_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1247792165&amp;sr=301-1">The Beach Boys---Summer Love Songs</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3535/3728204350_9d0677dc81_m.jpg" alt="The Beach Boys" width="234" height="179" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">---Okay, I don't need to convince you that the Beach Boys are good. They've withstood the test of time. I wanted a bit more than their greatest hits (currently on one of those compilations), so I went for the $5 mp3 download on Amazon. 20 Beach Boys songs for $5... nothing wrong with that, eh?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">
<hr style="text-align: left;" />
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">I'm usually excited when I discover (or somebody does for me) some new tunes, so I figured you might be interested as well. Until next time...</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
