excerpt: "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I'm usually one of those sons that tries
  with all that's in me to not laugh at something my mom thinks I will find funny.
  If I show her something that's funny, and we enjoy a laugh together, that's OK.
  The other way around, it just doesn't work. Is it a pride issue? Maybe. Is it her
  own fault? Probably. I claim I've been conditioned by her bad judgment in the past.
  ;-)</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Regardless of all that, I was introduced
  to this video by her. It apparently has gotten a lot of publicity (multi-million
  views on some sites), so you may have seen it. I suppose me being half-Korean makes
  this a little funnier, as I somewhat understood her Korean introduction and am all
  too familiar with the Korean-English accent."

<p style="text-align: left;">This is a short video of a little Korean kid "playing guitar" and singing "Hey Jude" the popular Beatles song. Enjoy! Until next time...</p>
