  numero uno. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure if I should intro at all, so IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going to
  save time and just say no.\r\n<p class=\"Body\">I went home this weekend for the
  2nd time since coming to big MU. My grandpa had his big 80th birthday celebration,
  and I got to celebrate my birthday with the family. It was a pretty good time. I
  got to see the family, eat an awesome birthday dinner, and kind of catch up with
  friends back home.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Friday
  night, after GÃ¢â‚¬â„¢paÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s celebration, I went over to my cousinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s
  house along with other cousins. I experienced my first minutes in the cyberWorld
  of Halo 3. It was a little anti-climaCtic (thanx, Sam...), mainly because IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve
  gotten quite rusty over the past year (yes, I definitely got pwned like a n00b).
  I blame my shortcomings on the small (nonHD) tv... The gameplayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty
  similar to 2, I just have a hard time adjusting to that whole right-bumper reloading
  concept. Eh, regardless, I had a good time and a few laughs (plus, who doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t
  enjoy gettinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ trash-talked/cussed out by their younger cousin...?).</p>\r\n"

<p class="Body">Later, I got to talking with my Uncle Jim about web stuff. It was one of the more exciting learning sessions, or whatever you want to call it, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had in a while. He knows a lot more than I do about web creation/design/publishing, and it was fascinating hearing what he had to say. I could follow nearly everything he said, despite never really doing a web stuff because of networking and other computer concepts IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve messed around with. I could actually converse intelligently with him (including tech current events :-)). ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just an awesome feeling seeing all the knowledge youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve acquired throughout a lifetime being applied/collaborated all in a single conversation. It makes you feel like youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doing something worthwhile or meaningful. Application of knowledge is a unique experience. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be delving into something my uncle told me about called the <a href="http://www.thirtydaychallenge.com/" title="http://www.thirtydaychallenge.com/">Thirty Day Challenge</a> if time allows me in the days to come... IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll keep you updated if I do.</p>
<p>                                  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rare to come in contact with people with similar interest(s) as myself who like to talk about tech things and are actually interesting when they do. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a big difference between conversing and blatant bragging... and the later is not so pleasant to listen to. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean for any of this to sound conceited or hypocritical. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve rubbed people the wrong way (sorry for those I have), and believe me, I know IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got a lot... a TON to still learn. With computers and technology, one could argue thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no reaching an end. Write me a calculator program in binary to prove me wrong... or something...<br />
Until next time...</p>
