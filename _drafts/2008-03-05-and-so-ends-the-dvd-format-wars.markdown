<p>Rest easy all you PS3 users. The DVD Format Wars are finally coming to a close after nearly 2 years ofÃ‚Â feuding. Blu-ray has toppled HD DVD (sorry Microsoft and Xbox).</p>
<p>Recent news has confirmed that major companies have abandoned HD DVD.Ã‚Â According to Wikipedia,Warner Bros, the last of the major studios still backing both formats, announced it would no longer produce HD DVD's starting in May '08. Paramount, Netflix, Wal-Mart, and Toshiba were the next to give HD DVD the boot.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, there was an effort to avoid this costly format war. Again, according to Wikipedia, the opposing sides began negotiating a compromise, but the issue of interactivity proved to be too daunting an obstacle to overcome. Blu-Ray endorsed "java based interactivity" while DVD Forum backed "Microsoft's iHD." *Cough* Stupid Microsoft *cough* :-)</p>
<p>Reading from a couple different sources (David Pogue in particular), this quick end seems to have arisen in direct response to a growing trend in digital/downloadable movies. I found that quite interesting because that thought had not even crossed my mind. It makes perfect sense though.Ã‚Â I, like most other sensible Americans, wouldn't think to break open the piggy bank for something that costs so much AND has unfavorable odds of becoming obsolete in months or even weeks.</p>
<p>Now that the war has ended, it would seem logical that middle-class America would venture out into the warmer spring weather, head over to their local electronics superstore, and purchase a new Blu-ray player (heck and maybe even upgrade from an old tube TV to a new LCD High Def TV). This can only help the movie industry, right?</p>
<p>I kind of wonder what impact this will have on PS3. Priced at about $500 (for the 80gb opposed to 40gb) it's maybe $100 more than the average Blu-Ray player, though I'd suspect we'll be seeing price drops in players in the months to come. I know I'd try to sell my parents on first buying a Blu-ray player... then casually direct them to the PS3.</p>
<p>I know what you're thinking... "What?! You're crazy! You already have a Wii! Why do you need a PS3?! You greedy *explicative*!" Okay, maybe you weren't thinking that. Regardless, I feel obligated to defend myself. The PS3 is a Blu-Ray player, it has potential DVR capabilities... without DRM issues (seeÃ‚Â <a href="http://gizmodo.com/360788/playstation-3-playtv-recordings-can-be-copied-anywhere" title="PS3 - DRM">this</a>Ã‚Â article), and... well... the Wii just isn't exactly appeasing my 1st Person Shooter and Sports desires (don't get me started on Fifa 08). Seems worth it to me. Will it happen? No.</p>
<p>Well... I've now officially witnessed a complete format war. What a milestone, eh? Ha ha, well it's time to do some homework. You folks take it easy.</p>
<p>Until next time...</p>
