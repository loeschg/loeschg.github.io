<p>Good old MacHeist just released it's third App Bundle! Woohoo!</p>
<p>This is a pretty good bundle, I must say. WireTap Studio is alone worth the price ($70 retail). It lets you record any audio that's playing on your Mac to an audio file. I recently purchased this earlier this year... haven't regretted it at all. It's not unlocked yet in the bundle, but I guarantee it will be soon.</p>
<p>For those of you interested, I'd be grateful if you'd purchase the $40 bundle through this link --&gt; <a href="http://www.macheist.com/bundle/u/94351/">http://www.macheist.com/bundle/u/94351/</a>. If you're just checking out the applications, you can look via that link, too.</p>
<p>I get some extra software if you buy through that link that I listed above... I really do think it's a great deal... I'm not just trying to get more software. I promise :)</p>
