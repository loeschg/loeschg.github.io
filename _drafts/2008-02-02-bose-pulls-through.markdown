excerpt: "So opposed to only sharing my negative experiences with you readers, I figured
  (partial thanks to FlossyChossy's encouragement) that I'd share something positive.
  As you regular readers know, I had a pretty frustrating day last week in which everything
  seemed to go wrong. I accidentally deleted my school Java project that I'd been
  working on for 3+ hours, had an interesting day of volunteering, and worst of all,
  my Bose Companion 3 speakers went *KABLEWY*... all these events transpired within
  hours of each other.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://greg-loesch.com/blog/mnt/w0506/d12/s06/b02ce878/www/greg-loesch.com/blog/blog.pics/2008/02/bose.gif\"

  I'll start with the most important issue... my speakers. To recap briefly, I came
  back from a church event the other day, opened my dorm room door, sat down to reprogram
  my Java project that I had accidentally deleted, and my roommate informed me that
  he had unplugged my computer speakers. As you can imagine I was like, \"You did
  what?! Why would you touch my speakers?\" But it turns out that it was a justifiable
  action. My speakers apparently blew out sometime during the 2 hours I was gone.
  They buzzed without ceasing until the power was shut-off/unplugged. I couldn't get
  anything other than the buzzing to come out either. It wasn't like I just had an
  irritating background buzz to my music, I got absolutely nothing but buzz from them.
  I was about ready to lose it at that moment, and the only thing that saved me my
  sanity was the hope that my speakers were still under warranty.\r\n\r\n"

<p>So I mustered up the courage two days later to give Bose a call and figure out whether or not they'd repair my speakers. I was very satisfied with the customer service/support that I received from Bose. After I entered all the appropriate numbers when prompted in the call menu, I was directed to the "miscellaneous repair" department. To my great surprise, I got through right away and immediately found myself talking to... *gasp*... a real person (and not one with a thick accent). I went on to explain my problem, and he asked me all the typical questions. He then went on to walk me through the elementary level trouble-shooting. I was very pleased with the way he instructed me, honestly. Normally you feel somewhat degraded when those tech guys walk you through that sort of stuff, but my intelligence was actually not insulted. Usually it's the whole *with an accent* "Is yo computa tuned on?" "Is yo monito tuned on?" "Do yo have lecitricity?" And you want to tell them is, "Listen here Habeebo. Stop reading off your stupid prompt. I know my computer's hard drive is dead. Believe me, I've tested it more ways than you will in your repair center. It's not like I wanted my hard drive to crash. Start filling out the appropriate forms so you can send me my replacement for your DEFECTIVE DRIVE... NOW!"</p>
<p class="paragraph_style">&nbsp;</p>
<p>So once I was finished with all the diagnostic stuff, the guy looked up all my information in their database. He had everything on file - yes, there is a benefit to registering new tech products when you receive them - and informed me, "Well, it looks like your warranty expired two weeks ago..."</p>
<p>*my heart stopped*</p>
<p>"BUT we definitely wouldn't charge you for the repair since it expired not too long ago." Whew, thank you Bose. My speakers are valued at like a little under $250 (I received them as a gift... unclench your fists), so I was going to  blow a fuse if they weren't going to repair them. However, unlike Apple (I have my issues with them in other areas though...), they were not going to send me a prepaid packing box. He did give me pretty good instructions/hints on how I should pack/send it, though. For the price of shipping, I was getting an extended 1 year warranty and a "free" repair. I guess that's worth it. The only other downside is that I have to wait 3+ weeks for my repair :-(</p>
<p class="paragraph_style">&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said, I was pretty pleased with the support that I was given. Bose definitely gets my approval in the area of repairs and warranties. Not too long ago, I called Bose about a pair of TriPorts headphones that were buzzing and cracked (I had stepped on them...). I asked Bose how much the repair would cost, and I was informed that they no longer repaired that model. He said usually they send replacement headphones for $50 if out of warranty, but in this case, he said they'd replace them for free. My jaw almost dropped when I heard that. The majority of the damage was caused by my carelessness, and I wasn't even ORIGINAL OWNER! Granted I didn't offer that information (don't ask, don't tell). I even got a different color :-). I am actually enjoying the wonderful quality of my Bose TriPorts right now, listening to a little Jars of Clay.</p>

<p>In case you were considering, don't bash Bose product's value (even though of my 2 products, both have broken...). I've read a couple different reviews for Bose products, and there's always one guy who's ripping Bose a new one. Sure their products may be somewhat overpriced at times, but the service and quality are definitely top-notch. That's one thing you will not hear me complaining about when it comes to large companies with expensive products. Sure you may be shelling out more $$ than you would for a similar product from another less prestigious company, but if you give the pricier company your money, 19 out of 20 times they'll make sure you're taken care of. If nothing else, you feel it's your right to raise hell if things go wrong. I suppose it's the least they can do, but like I said, I'm focusing on the positives in this entry. It's nice to see big corporations acting with human decency.</p>

<p>Well, that's enough typing. Until next time...</p>
