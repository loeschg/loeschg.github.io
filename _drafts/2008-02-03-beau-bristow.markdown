  a couple hours ago, I got to watch a new up and coming artist, Beau Bristow, play
  at a local coffee shop here at school. I''ve been listening to this guy for over
  a year now, and I really like his stuff. My sister bought one of his albums, <em>Coffee
  not Included</em>, a year or so ago, and I''ve been listening to it on and off since.
  I just bought his new album <em>Standing. Still.</em> tonight, and I''m a fan.  Not
  only is he musically talented, he seems to be a pretty solid guy. Aside from an
  awkward greeting (He thought I said he was great, but I actually said, "Hey, I''m
  Greg." I mean he was great, but still... it was kind of awkward), he was pretty
  easy to talk to. He seemed genuinely interested. Makes me like him as an artist
  that much more<p class="paragraph_style">Ã‚Â </p>'

    the review. Ha ha ha, and I'm glad I didn't say anything bad about you :wink:
    \r\n\r\nI would have called you great after the introduction anyway, so I wouldn't
    call you a dork...\r\n\r\nSo, any progress on those tabs???"

<p>Just a couple hours ago, I got to watch a new up and coming artist, Beau Bristow, play at a local coffee shop here at school. I've been listening to this guy for over a year now, and I really like his stuff. My sister bought one of his albums, <em>Coffee not Included</em>, a year or so ago, and I've been listening to it on and off since. I just bought his new album <em>Standing.

<p class="paragraph_style">Ã‚Â </p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-40"></a>Beau plays acoustic guitar and sings, and I guess I'd classify him as an acoustic rock artist. I won't compare him to anyone else specifically that I've heard because I hate it when reviewers do that. It often times gives a false impression. Plus, I think he's got sort of a unique sound. He's got a good simple, clean, crisp, and controlled style of playing and singing. I asked him if he had guitar tabs for his stuff, and he told me he's working on releasing them. I'm pretty happy about that, as I think his music would be satisfying to play. He's fun to watch live, as he's pretty proficient with the whole looping concept. He layers himself playing with relative ease. It's not overkill either. Some guys who have the ability to loop like that just go way over the top. He's not flashy either, which I consider a good characteristic. He's not slapping the strings and playing ridiculously fast. His music is... tasteful and melodically satisfying. To tie it all together, his lyrics can be related to. They're not too simple, but they're not overly ambiguous. From the way he sings, you can tell he's writing with true feeling. It was refreshing.

<p>I'm listening to his new album right now actually, and I really like the songs "Maybe Love's Just Not Enough" and "Stand." When I talked to him afterward, he said that those two were his personal favorites. Perhaps I'm just biased because the artist himself likes 'em... who knows. You should give him a shot and check out his new stuff at <a href="http://www.beaubristow.com" title="Beau Bristow">www.beaubristow.com</a>. Also, take a listen to his older stuff on iTunes if you haven't heard him before. Some good stuff. I'm really hoping he gets a shot at making it big.Here's a photo of his new album's cover. Perhaps this will save somebody the trouble of having Ã‚Â to scan the album cover to add to iTunes album art.
