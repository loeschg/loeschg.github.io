<p>It was brought to my attention that nearly all the links to blog posts are currently broken. I just recently switched web-hosts, and the migration didn't go as smoothly as I had hoped. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I'm working to resolve this ASAP.</span> Everything is now working as it should :)</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience!</p>
