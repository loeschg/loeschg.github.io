<p>After a bit of tinkering, I finally got everything up and running again. I really don't know which plugin it was exactly that was bogging my site down so much. I just deactivated and reactivated all of them, and my blog is running quite a bit faster.</p>
<p>I even got Mark Jaquith's Subscribe to Comments Wordpress plug-in to work properly. I was having some trouble with the location of the check-box to subscribe (it appeared in the footer and extended the main body of my blog to the last sidebar widget. Not exactly pretty. I contacted Mark via <a title="Twitter - Compulsiveguile" href="http://twitter.com/compulsiveguile" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and email, and he got me all squared away. That's my first experience where I've really found Twitter priceless. I'm definitely hooked. It turned out that all I had to do was add the following line to the end of my blog's CSS.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-225"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>p.subscribe-to-comments { clear: none !important; }</p></blockquote>
<p>It's nice havin' everything back up and running the way it's supposed to be running. Now that that's all good and peachy, my next goal is to work on a new homepage. I'm not exactly satisfied with the one I currently <a title="Greg Loesch's Site" href="http://greg-loesch.com" target="_blank">have</a>. I recently purchased RapidWeaver, so I'll be mucking my way through that. I'm hoping I find myself terribly flattered by the new program.</p>

<p>I need some sleep, so I'm off to bed. Until next time...</p>
