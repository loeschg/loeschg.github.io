<p style="text-align: left;">Just this past weekend, I finally went out and bought one of those Nike+iPod sensors for running. I have an iPod Touch 2G, so it only set me back $20. For those of you who don't know, this incredible little device allows you to keep track of distances you have run, the amount of time it took you to run that distance, along with some other useful stats all from your iPod.Â  Once your workout is finished, simply connect your iPod to your computer, and iTunes will prompt you to head on over to nikeplus.com. With a simple click, you're taken to the website, and a nice little graph is displayed for you (you're prompted to create an account the first time) showing your running statistics (see below). Trust me... 1.67 miles was enough for my first run.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Nike - Run1" rel="lightbox[pics311]" href="http://greg-loesch.com/blog/pics/2009/03/nike.png"><img class="attachment wp-att-314 centered" src="http://greg-loesch.com/blog/pics/2009/03/nike.png" alt="Nike - Run1" width="525" height="217" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a id="more"></a><a id="more-311"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let me be the first to tell you that I have never really enjoyed running just to run. Even when playing soccer, I don't really like running much. That's why I played stopper (defensive mid). I don't think it's laziness... though it is possible I just never got in shape enough to enjoy running longer distances.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, with the Nike + iPod sensor, things seem to be (and hopefully will continue to be) better. My usual complaints with running usually have something to do with never knowing exactly how far I ran, never knowing exactly how fast I ran, not liking/owning a good pair of running shoes, and... I'll be honest... I'd rather play video games :). With the Nike sensor, the first two of those problems are solved, and it also gives me a bit more motivation as I enjoy looking at stats that pertain to me (along with progress made).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The other shoe problem was easily solved by heading out to DSW and purchasing some new running shoes. When purchasing shoes, I had to deal with the whole issue of whether or not to buy non-Nike brand shoes and a pouch to carry the sensor or to give in and buy a pair of Nike shoes that have the built in insole slot and pay an average of $20 more than other shoes.Â  I tried a few pairs on, and I ended up going with a pair of Saucony <a title="Saucony Grid C2 Roadster" href="http://www.saucony.com/ShoeDetails.aspx?gen=m&amp;use=Run&amp;id=1150&amp;rel=1118,1110,1107,1148,1109,1140,1138,1104,1113,1041,1076,1102,1067,1064,1062,1146,1134,1136,1155,1157,1159,1152,1150">shoes</a>. I know nothing about running shoes... They felt good, and I liked the style :). I'll admit that I almost gave in to marketing and bought Nike shoes that were $20 more than the Saucony shoes and were less comfortable. I decided I'd risk the added "bulk" of a sensor carrying case.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I went home, hopped on my computer, Googled for a bit, and I ended up finding some creative ways to attach the iPod + Nike sensor. There are some <a href="http://www.grantwoodtechnology.com/shoepouch/">retail options</a> that pretty much are a sort of pouch/sleeve that you attach to your laces. I considered, but those would set me back another $10. Other "shoe hacks" that I found included literally cutting open the tongues of the shoe, inserting the chip, and simply safety pinning the opening (see <a title="Cut tongue" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Put-an-iPod-Nike%2B-sensor-in-any-running--shoe-in-o/">this article</a>). Sure it adds no extra bulk, but I was by no means ready to take a razor blade to my new shoes. Another option was the <a href="http://walking.about.com/od/pedometer1/ss/nikeplussensor_6.htm">velcro trick</a>. That involved me going out and buying velcro and possibly sewing. I ended up going with a good old "MacGuyver" technique the involved using a basic plastic zip-lock bag and nothing else. See this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gv5ZwTS3io ">YouTube video</a>. Simple and low cost, and it seemed to work pretty well, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I'm still combating the desire to play Fallout 3 opposed to running. Sorry... no tips there.</p>
