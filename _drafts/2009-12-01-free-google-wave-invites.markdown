    looking for a Google Voice and/or Google Wave invite? I can accommodate you in
    the Google Wave area. I'm fresh out of Voice invites. Just let me know."

<p>I was one of the fortunate individuals who received an early Google Voice invite. I honestly haven't done a whole lot with it, mainly because I don't know many people that have it... but I will say it's pretty nifty nifty. In case you're out of the loop, here's a quick, concise video demonstrating Google Wave.</p>
<p>[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6pgxLaDdQw&amp;feature=player_embedded[/youtube]</p>
<p>So... I have 5 invites that I'm going to give away for... wait for it... FREE! <a id="more"></a><a id="more-561"></a>It's very possible that these invites are as common as Uggs and North Face jackets on a college campus during the early winter, but what the heck, these invites aren't doing any good sitting in my wave box or whatever the heck you want to call it. I figure somebody has to want them.</p>
<p>So, here's the deal. To get your hands on one of the invites, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><em>leave a comment at the bottom of this post with humorous/clever "famous last words<strong>.</strong>"</em> For example: "What car?" or "No, these are the good kind of mushrooms..." or "Race ya to the other side of the golf driving range!"</span> <strong>just post a comment</strong>... these things aren't in high demand anymore I presume. I'll send it to ya as soon as I get the comment. Cheers!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I'll pick my favorite 5 this weekend (<em>get 'em posted by Saturday - 12/5 !</em>) and send the invites to the emails used to post the comment. Keep in mind I don't have tons of followers, so your chances are pretty good. I may also be accepting bribes. Keep 'em original... I know how to use Google, too ;)</span></p>
