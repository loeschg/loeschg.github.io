<p>I just thought I would share my opinion of the decision that the British band Radiohead has made relating to the release of their new album.</p>
<p class="paragraph_style">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="paragraph_style">FOXNewÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s headline reads Ã¢â‚¬Å“<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,300549,00.html" onkeypress="window.open(this.href); return false;" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" title="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,300549,00.html" class="class1">RadioheadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Web-Only Release Threatens Music Industry</a>Ã¢â‚¬Â</p>
<p class="paragraph_style">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="paragraph_style">TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re BRILLIANT, and I love the idea! For those of you who havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t heard, Radiohead has decided to release a downloadable version (actual hard-copy  is available sometime in like December) of their new album for whatever price you name.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-24"></a> I repeat, <span class="style_1">you name your own price</span>. Want to pay $1? Go for it ( ...cheapskate ;-) ). Want to shell out $35 to support the cause? By all means. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think you can opt for negative...</p>
<p class="paragraph_style">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="paragraph_style">For obvious reasons, I think, this is an ingenious idea. Aside from the marketing brilliance, - I mean honestly, how many people would have even known about RadioheadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new album release, let alone the band Radiohead - this shows that Radiohead recognizes how big pirating is. They understand that people want free and <span class="style_2">convenient </span>music. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just life. As long as people can get it for free, the masses arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t going to buy music legally. Do I think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to pirate? By no means. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m very much against it. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m just saying this is human nature. Alright... so you make the free a little harder to get, and as long as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s convenient... eh... people will be willing to shell out a little $ (One word - iTunes). Now, Radiohead is employing an intermediate step between free and convenient. You allow people to conveniently <span class="style_2">choose </span>their price, and I think theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll come flocking.</p>
<p class="paragraph_style">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="paragraph_style">Sure, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to have those who will pay Ã‚Â£0.01 (remember itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the UK), but still... theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re paying <span class="style_2">something</span> arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t they? I think most people, like me, will be more than willing to spend $5 or so (yes, that is what I paid... the equivalent to Ã‚Â£2 plus tax... itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not my fault the $ is worth nothing anymore...). I usually try to pay, on average, $10 for an album. If itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a 2-CD set, maybe $14.99. Though through <a href="http://www.bmgmusic.com/index.jhtml;jsessionid=ZJE3AIPYQVA3UCTI0UZSFEY?_requestid=78166" onkeypress="window.open(this.href); return false;" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" title="http://www.bmgmusic.com/index.jhtml;jsessionid=ZJE3AIPYQVA3UCTI0UZSFEY?_requestid=78166" class="class2">BMG</a> (let me know if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re interested in signing up... I get perks form it), I can get several CDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s for an average of $5.75 a pop. I figure if I can get the hard copy, for a little over $5, by all means $5 is a reasonable price to pay for the downloadable Radiohead album. I really hope that this revolutionizes... or at least changes the music industry. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a long shot, but perhaps it will bring some sort of long-overdue balance. Those who pay for their music are punished by those who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t through higher CD costs... *sigh*</p>
