  content: "Ya about the whole \"working the blue tape v6\"...v is the scale used
    in the bouldering aspect of climbing and 6 happens to be a mid range difficulty.
    \ People will often mark their holds with tape, different colors for different
    levels of difficulty and so on.  \r\n\r\nSo thats that, glad you found the article
    funny man."

<p>With Valentine's Day right around the corner, it's only appropriate to write/share something about it, right? While I am not a big fan of the "holiday" myself (not when I'm dating somebody or when I'm single... like now), the complaining that goes along with Valentine's Day is really what can drive me to the edge. Yeah, people who participate are often times disgusting about it, but all of you who normally sulk in your loveless misery, try to shape up and live your life normally. God still loves you :D</p>
<p>My good friend sent me an email with an article a climber wrote. I'm not an outdoorsman, but I found his article pretty funny. I don't quite understand the paragraph about "working the blue tape v6," but it was still an enjoyable read. Check out the articleÃ‚Â <a href="http://www.rockandice.com/tnblast/021208tnb.html" title="Rock and Ice">here</a>.Ã‚Â </p>
