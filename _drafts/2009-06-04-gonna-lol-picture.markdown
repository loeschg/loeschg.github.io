<p>I came across this on StumbleUpon, and I think I laughed out loud by myself when I saw it.Â  That's usually a good indication that it's pretty funny. Okay... I may have just smiled. This has made its way around Digg, so it's a good possibility that some of you have already seen it. Without delaying further... here she is...</p>

<p>*Snicker* Oh you Pokemon jokes. Ya get me every time.</p>
<p>If you don't get it, it's okay... it just means you were either kept in a box when you were younger or you're...well... "in one's dotage." Okay, maybe you were "above" Pokemon. And by "above" I mean that you probably like bands people have never heard of... but don't worry... we'll like them soon, and you'll have to force yourself to abhor them and go find another obscure band.</p>
<p>Cheers :)</p>
