<p>Due to troublesome and indescribably frustrating loading times in my Wordpress Dashboard, I'm disabling all my plugins temporarily. I have started posting frequently through <a title="MarsEdit" href="www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/" target="_blank">MarsEdit</a>, but I'd like to be able to pop online and blog, too.</p>
<p>My loading times have started taking over a minute sometimes when posting. It's ridiculous. I don't know whether to blame something in Wordpress (such as plugins) or to blame my web-host. If anyone has any brilliant suggestions, I'm all ears and eyes.</p>
