  <p>This weeks Apple Event, Let's Rock, was one that really didn't offer anything terribly surprising. Thanks to inside source leaks (I tend to think it was planned) and the wildfire tendencies of the internet and social networking, most of Apple's unveilings were already expected.

  <p>That being said, I am happy to see updates for the iPod line. I'm definitely a fan of the new Nanos (the colors make my mouth water a little bit), I'm happy to see the price drop in the Touch - as little as it was (I want one... bad...), and I'm pleased with the new iTunes Genius feature. I was also really pleased with their guest musician :smile:, which is really what this post is all about. </p>

  content: Thanks for this. The "custom" album cover didn't appear for me and tracks
    weren't numbered, but I am a nitpicker...

  content: "Hm... I'm not sure why the album art didn't come through. My \"custom\"
    album artwork was just a screenshot from the podcast that I have above the song
    links. Just click on the picture to go to my Flickr page and save that (if you're
    interested in having artwork). That's all that I really did.  \r\n\r\nI didn't
    number the tracks, I will admit :smile:  \r\n\r\nThanks for informing me!"

<p>This weeks Apple Event, Let's Rock, was one that really didn't offer anything terribly surprising. Thanks to inside source leaks (I tend to think it was planned) and the wildfire tendencies of the internet and social networking, most of Apple's unveilings were already expected. Heck, with all the rumors flying around, this was slightly disappointing.</p>
<p>That being said, I am happy to see updates for the iPod line. I'm definitely a fan of the new Nanos (the colors make my mouth water a little bit), I'm happy to see the price drop in the Touch - as little as it was (I want one... bad...), and I'm pleased with the new iTunes Genius feature. I was also really pleased with their guest musician :smile:, which is really what this post is all about. </p>

<p>This time around, Jack Johnson, hailed as iTunes #1 most downloaded male artist, played three songs (Sleep through the Static, All at Once, and Better Together)Ã‚Â for all the Mac/iPod fanatics with just his acoustic guitar and soothing mellow voice. To be honest, I thought he looked a little nervous to be in front of the tech-oriented crowd. He probably felt a little out of his element seeing as his last album was recorded through mainly solar power from his beach house probably in between surf sessions. Regardless, his performance was thoroughly enjoyable.</p>
<p>I liked the songs so much that I actually separated out the audio and split it into respective songs. I just purchased Ambrosia Software's <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/wiretap" target="_blank">WireTap Studio</a> from a charity software auction (Along with <a href="http://www.manytricks.com/witch/" target="_blank">Witch</a>, <a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/" target="_blank">RapidWeaver</a>, and <a href="http://foggynoggin.com/desktopple" target="_blank">DeskTopple Pro</a> all for $75!), so I was dying to try it out. I'm definitely pleased with the performance. Tons of options, and the program is incredibly intuitive (felt really natural after watching their short screencasts on the website). I was starting to regret that I bought WireTap Studio, as I was having a hard time thinking of practical uses. This was perfect!</p>
<p>I figure there might be some of you out there who might want the "Let's Rock" Apple iPod event's original Jack Johnson acoustic guitar music/songs in iTunes friendly mp3 versions with tags and "custom" artwork already embedded... so here they are. I doubt this would be available anywhere else, so I don't think I'm doing anything illegal. Again, I'm sure I'll be informed if I am :wink:</p>
<p>The songs are listed below in the order of their performance, including the main snippet of Jack Johnson's "Thank you." Just 'Right-click->Save link as' to download.</p>
<h4>Note:  There's a possibility the file will want to download as "click.php." Simply rename it as "*song-name*.mp3" and you're all set. </h4>
<p>Just give it a click if you want to simply listen. They're pretty high quality recordings (a couple MB each).<br />

<p>Well hopefully you enjoy. Like I said before, these should be 100% iTunes friendly with the correct Artist, Album, and Genre tags. Album Artwork should also be embedded. Let me know if you run into any snags. If you like it, feel free to share :wink: </p>
