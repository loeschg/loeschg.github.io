excerpt: "I saw an interesting video on YouTube the other day. Coldplay's new single
  \"Viva la Vida\" (if you haven't taken a listen, you need to. It's a great song)
  sounds eerily familiar to a riff from Joe Satriani's song \"If I could Fly.\" He's
  a sweet guitarist from... the late 80's and 90's...I think. Pretty talented guy.\r\n<p

<p>I saw an interesting video on YouTube the other day. Coldplay's new single "Viva la Vida" (if you haven't taken a listen, you need to. It's a great song) sounds eerily familiar to a riff from Joe Satriani's song "If I could Fly." He's a sweet guitarist from... the late 80's and 90's...I think. Pretty talented guy.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I don't really think Coldplay ripped this off of Satriani, but it's still kind of odd, don't you think? I think they should get together and make a remix :).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">To give you an idea of what it might sound like, take a listen to this. This was mixed by YouTube user <a title="iGotSpaceLikeNASA's YouTube homepage" href="http://youtube.com/user/iGotSpaceLikeNASA" target="_blank">iGotSpaceLikeNASA</a>.</p>
<pre>[audio:Viva La Vida vs If I Could Fly.mp3|titles=Viva la Vida vs If I Could Fly|artists=Coldplay and Joe Satriani]</pre>
<p style="text-align: left;">Click the play button above to take a listen. I thought it was pretty kool. If you want that mp3, just shoot him a message at his YouTube site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Until next time...</p>
