    using iWeb, but what you're looking at right now is actually Wordpress. \r\n\r\nIf
    you have your own web-space (web-hosting) then you can get this service for free.\r\n\r\nI'm
    a fan :-)"

  content: I'm disappointed that the respondents were only thinking of themselves
    and their immediate pleasures - having more sex/becoming millionaires/marrying
    millionaires - instead of finding ways to bring joy or enhance the lives of those
    around them in New Orleans. The film is not as touching or in any way enlightening
    as I had hoped.

  content: "Jeff,\r\n\r\nPossibly that is the enlightening part for some, that if
    you really think honestly and selfishly, the first thing you'd wish for isn't
    what you'd proclaim it to be."

<p>"50 People, One Question" by <a title="Benjamin Reece - Vimeo" href="http://vimeo.com/deltree" target="_blank">Benjamin Reece</a> is one of the most touching short videos that I've seen in a while. It's hard to point to what exactly struck that emotional chord, but my guess it has something to do with the deep implications that question arises. The music accompanying the video definitely adds a ton. The power of music is pretty incredible. It has always been something that fascinates me.</p>
<p>This video is a breath of fresh air. It brings back memories, stimulates the mind, and is quite inspirational all the while stirring up emotion. Even if you're at work reading this, it's worth taking the couple of minutes to watch. Shows the diversity of mankind while also the underlying similarities. It's a pretty high-quality vid, so give it time to load. Enjoy.</p>
