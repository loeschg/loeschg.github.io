  content: I saw this and thought it was super cool.  But I guess for me it was one
    of those viral videos that I wasn't sure if it was real or not.  Call me a skeptic,
    I guess.

  content: "Ha ha, I don't think I'd classify you as a skeptic for your reasoning
    on that one. A fake online video? Never...\r\n\r\nA video clip of Christian was
    aired -actually looked like it was being streamed from YouTube- on a major news
    station (maybe NBC... I don't remember), so this must be legit."

<p>This must be a relatively old video, but I'd never seen it before. I saw this on my new Twitter friend's (<a title="MEHayden" href="http://twitter.com/MEHayden" target="_blank">MEHayden</a>) page. Aerosmith is perfect for this vid :). I thought this was awesome...</p>
