  content: "Greg,\r\n\r\nThanks for the movie reviews.  I haven't seen Across or Legend,
    but I have scene Dan in Real Life.  It was certainly a good movie to take my wife
    to, and I did enjoy the movie quite a bit, along with the soundtrack, which I
    bought on iTunes shortly after the show and used in many of my family videos.
    \ I was reluctant to see Across due to some poor reviews, but after reading your
    review I may give it a shot.  I'll certainly see Legend when I can get it through
    Netflix.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  content: "The Beatles music redone in Across the Universe is taken different ways
    by different people. Being a person who hasn't listened to much of the Beatles
    other than \"Abby Road\" on occasion, a selection of the music was somewhat \"new\"
    to me. That will most likely make or break the movie for you. If you can tolerate
    somebody else redoing the Beatles genius, you'll be fine :-).\r\nAlso so you know,
    it isn't exactly a family movie."

<p>I posted previously that I saw quite a few movies, at least more than I had in the past 3 months combined, over break. At one point, I saw three movies in the theater<em> </em>in as many days. Those movies are listed above, as you guessed. So you know, <em>Across the Universe</em> and <em>Dan in Real Life</em> were in the cheap theater... so I didn't dish out $20 to see all three. Here's my take on the films:<a id="more"></a><a id="more-21"></a></p>
<p>The 1st, <em>Across the Universe, </em>was alright. The music was awesome, as I'm now a fan of Jim Sturgess (buy the soundtrack or at least the song "Something" by Jim), but it was a little too "artsy" for me. The beginning was good, the middle was... well let's just say they did a good job making you feel like you're on drugs, and the end was good. I could have done without some of the "figure" art, if you catch my drift... call me closed minded. It didn't add anything for me. There were some gripping dramatic moments, which I enjoy more than I like to admit, some subtle humor, and some good camera work. I didn't know what I thought of the movie right after seeing it, but after letting it marinade, I'd say it was pretty good.</p>
<p><em> I Am Legend</em>, is one of the most intense movies I have ever seen. I don't remember ever watching a movie and being so concerned about jumping in my seat out of surprise. I think the suspense factor definitely makes the movie. I liked the plot (yes, I know it's a remake... but it's new to me), though in retrospect, it moved a little slow at times for me. Will Smith plays his part well, and it's a typical Will Smith acting job (take it however you'd like). He looks legitimately scared in the "terror" scenes, sincerely sorrowful in the sad scenes (how's that for some alliteration?), and his witty humor is relaxing. Though I wish I wouldn't have paid what I paid to see it, it was entertaining and is definitely worth a watch.</p>
<p><em>Dan in Real Life</em> was definitely my favorite of the three. It's not Steve Carell's funniest movie, which is good because it's somewhat of a drama, but it's my favorite movie of his as of right now. To give you an abstract idea, it falls somewhere between <em>Anchorman</em> and <em>Little Miss Sunshine, </em>though it strays more toward the latter. He's pretty talented in the ways of awkward comedy, and he pulls it off perfectly in this one.  I thought this might be the sort of movie like <em>Meet the Parents </em>or<em> Anger Management </em>in which absolutely everything goes wrong for the guy - I HATE those sort of movies - but that wasn't the case. The director found a good balance. The title is apt as it really seems like a guy in every day life. As much as I hate to say this after admitting it's one of my favorite movies, it really is a good family movie. My parents loved it along with my grandma. It's possible I may have just watched it in the perfect emotional state, but I'd say that <em>Dan in Real Life </em>is a must see.</p>
<p>That's my opinion of the movies... hope somebody finds this of some use. Until next time...</p>
