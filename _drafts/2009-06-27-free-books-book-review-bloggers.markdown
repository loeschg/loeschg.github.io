<p style="text-align: left;">I just found out from a friend, Sam Schoutko (<a title="Wasilly - Twitter - Sam Schoutko" href="http://twitter.com/wasilly">@Wasilly</a> &amp; check out his <a title="Sam Schoutko - Blog" href="http://ahiashere.wordpress.com">blog</a>), about this book review program at <a href="http://brb.thomasnelson.com">brb.thomasnelson.com</a>. The concept is relatively simple, and I'd assume quite effective in a marketing sense.</p>
<p><a title="Thomas Nelson" href="http://brb.thomasnelson.com"><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3392/3666295561_f7e32c8b7f.jpg" alt="Thomas Nelson" width="287" height="80" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is how it works:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You fill out an application that is composed pretty much of name, address, blog url, and book interests. From there, you wait to get approved (took about a day for them to respond). Once approved, you select a book, and they mail it to you for free! The only thing you have to do is write a review on your blog and a retail site of your choosing. If you hate the book, let the people know. If you love it, let 'em know. Once the two reviews are finished, you send them the links and pick another free book.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I'll be honest, one of my motives is to get "A Million Miles in a Thousand Years" by Donald Miller (<a title="Don Miller - Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/donmilleris">@DonMillerIs</a>) for free - despite him blocking me on Twitter... (what the heck is that about by the way, Don?!) - but I also hope it motivates me in that whole book reading area.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Like to blog and read? Go fill out that app! Tough to beat free (I'm pullin' for your application to go through, Sammy).</p>
