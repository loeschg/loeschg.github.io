  It had been awhile since I had heard an update regarding the <a href="http://greg-loesch.com/blog/conficker-virus/" target="_blank">latest/greatest virus</a> called Conficker (click that link to read more about it). Apparently there has been some sort of update to the virus's source code (?) that has alerted all of those frantically scrambling to figure out what the heck this virus is actually going to do that it may do something crazy on April 1st... April Fool's Day. I'm excited :)</p>

  content: "Good afternoon, Happy Fool's Day!!\r\n\r\nA seaman meets a pirate in a
    bar, and talk turns to their adventures on the sea. The seaman notes that the
    pirate has a peg-leg, a hook, and an eye patch.\r\nThe seaman asks, \"So, how
    did you end up with the peg-leg?\" \r\nThe pirate replies, \"We were in a storm
    at sea, and I was swept overboard into a school of sharks. Just as my men were
    pulling me out, a shark bit my leg off.\"\r\n\"Wow!\" said the seaman. \"What
    about your hook?\" \r\n\"Well,\" replied the pirate, \"We were boarding an enemy
    ship and were battling the other sailors with swords. One of the enemy cut my
    hand off.\"\r\n\"Incredible!\" remarked the seaman. \"How did you get the eye
    patch?\" \r\n\"A seagull dropping fell into my eye,\" replied the pirate.\r\n\"You
    lost your eye to a seagull dropping?\" the sailor asked incredulously.\r\n\"Well,\"
    said the pirate, \"it was my first day with my hook.\"\r\n \r\n\r\nHappy April
    Fool's Day!"
