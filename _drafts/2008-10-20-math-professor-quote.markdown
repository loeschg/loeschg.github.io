<p>So today in class, one of my fellow students asked our math professor how he detemines the length of time we get to take the mid term. He explained that he times how long it takes for him to take the exam and multiplies that by 6.</p>
<p>That means it takes us an hour to do what takes him ten minutes...  I thought that was pretty funny.   </p>
