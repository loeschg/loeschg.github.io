  around with time-lapse videos. Final Cut Express and iMovie were obvious options
  to create the video... but I didn't want to mess with Final Cut for such a simple
  task (plus that's not free). Most of the suggestions I came across on the internet
  said to use Quicktime Player, but I got a bit confused as the new version of Quicktime
  Player (Quicktime Player X) included with Snow Leopard (stupidly) doesn't have the
  ability to create time lapse videos. However, Quicktime Player 7 (the old version
  that has the ability to do so), is most likely still installed on your computer.
  Way to make things confusing, Apple. Anywhooo ... here's the process of creating
  a time lapse video from stills using Quicktime (free) in Snow Leopard:\r\n"

  content: "Thanks this helped a lot, I just updated to 10.6 and thought that I lost
    Quick Time Pro 7.\r\n\r\nAlso, you can export from Quick Time Pro 7 too.  It is
    probably not as intuitive, but it does work.\r\n\r\nGreg"

  content: Thanks for the tutorial. The app you tutor on is not QuickTime Player 7.
    It's QuickTime Player Pro 7. It doesn't come with the OS software; like Final
    Cut Pro, it's not free. Darn!

  content: "Hey Dale, I could be mistaken, but I'm fairly certain that I used QuickTime
    Player 7. I don't have any registration/credential info listed under 'Registration.'
    I certainly don't recall purchasing a Pro license... :P \n\nIf you have any trouble,
    let me know. Maybe I can help you out!"

  content: I just checked, too. I have QT Player 7.6.9, and the Open Image Sequence
    selection is grayed out with "PRO" indicated. Methinks that Apple figured it out
    and changed it in an update. Thanks for the tutorial, though! It helps me decide
    whether I want to spend the $30 for QTPro.

<p>I just purchased my first DSLR camera this summer (Nikon D5000) and have been messing around with time-lapse videos. Final Cut Express and iMovie were obvious options to create the video... but I didn't want to mess with Final Cut for such a simple task (plus that's not free).

Anywhooo ... here's the process of creating a time lapse video from stills using Quicktime (free) in Snow Leopard:<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-628"></a></p>
<ol>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Import your photos to a separate folder</strong> someplace on your hard drive. I suggest using Image Capture instead of iPhoto since you can import directly to a folder... whatever works, though.</li>
<li><strong>Navigate to and open Quicktime 7</strong><em> </em>(<strong>not</strong> Quicktime X) by going to <strong><em>Applications -&gt; Utilities</em></strong></li>
<li>Go to <strong><em>File -&gt; Open Image Sequence</em></strong><img class="aligncenter" src="http://cl.ly/46b308bd0e579c1404f8/content" alt="Screenshot - Open" width="429" height="205" /></li>
<li><strong>Navigate to the folder containing your pictures</strong> and <strong>select the first picture</strong>. Quicktime will automatically grab all the images in the folder.</li>
<li>In the selection window that pops up, <strong>select the number of frames you want per second</strong> (number of images that will comprise a single second) and click OK.<br />
<a href="http://cl.ly/4e600c418bf2965fe311/content"><img class="aligncenter" title="Frames per second" src="http://cl.ly/4e600c418bf2965fe311/content" alt="Frames per second" width="380" height="214" /></a></li>
<li>Once the images load, change the view by going to <em><strong>View -&gt; Fit-To-Screen</strong></em> (Command + 3) to get a better look if your resolution is larger than your computer screen.</li>
<li><strong>Save by going to <em>File -&gt; Save</em>.</strong><br />
--Technically you could stop here or simply export the video using whatever format you please. The pictures I used were quite large, and I had little luck determining which export settings work best. I find it easier to export with QuickTime Player X. Keep reading.</li>
<li>Navigate to and <strong>open QuickTime Player X</strong> (<em>Applications -&gt; QuickTime Player</em>).</li>
<li>When opened, <strong>click the Export button </strong>and select the desired export setting. I found the iTunes setting works pretty well if you want a decent sized movie without taking up too much hard drive space. Once this is finished, you'll probably want to delete the original video to save some hard drive space.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cheers!</p>
