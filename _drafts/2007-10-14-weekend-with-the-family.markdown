<p>The surgery definitely turned out to be a positive thing in more ways than just my dadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health. Not to sound selfish or anything, it was awesome getting to see a lot of my extended family. I got to see my Uncle Jim, his three boys, my grandparents, my cousin Dan (whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on leave from overseas), his family, as well as my own family. I really have been blessed with an awesome family, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no denying that.</p>

<p>Friday night, the only negative was the IndianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s defeat at the hands of the Red Sox.Things definitely only improved sports-wise for the majority of OH fans the next day. Indians pulled out the W, we beat BGSU in our homecoming game (Can you say 3-0 in the MAC?), OSU crushed Kent (sorry friends from Kent... :-) ), UK beat #1 ranked LSU, and Oregon State squeaked by #2 Cal. And once again, OSU will move to the big #1 spot in the BCS. *Sigh of satisfaction*.</p>

<p>I spend the night at my uncleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, and we chatted (including my cousin, Andrew) Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtil 3 AM about web stuff. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so much to know about site design. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crazy.</p>

<p class="paragraph_style_2">The rest of the weekend, I just hung out with family and friends. I threw the disc around with my cousin, had a good home-cooked meal at the grandparentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, played some Halo 3 (not so much pwnage this time), and worked on my site with David til way too late again (check out my <a href="http://greg-loesch.com/Home/Mac/Entries/2007/10/13_Tip_2_-_Mac_and_PC%3A_Save_YouTube_forever_%28and_add_it_to_your_iPod%29%21.html" class="class1" title="../../../../Mac/Entries/2007/10/13_Tip_2_-_Mac_and_PC:_Save_YouTube_forever_(and_add_it_to_your_iPod)!.html">new computer tip</a> - applies to both PC and Mac!).</p>

<p style="padding-bottom: 0pt" class="paragraph_style_2">Now I sit in the car being rocked side-to-side, growing sick, while Brett flies down the back roads heading back to school, typing this entry. A freshman crusade meeting and physics await me. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m hoping for a productive, settling evening. Until next time...</p>
