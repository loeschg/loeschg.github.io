excerpt: "I thought I'd be posting alot more over Christmas break, but I was most
  undoubtedly wrong. I mean it's not like I haven't been working on my website and
  such, I just have been busy tinkering with other things such as setting up this
  blog and purchasing/setting up my own personal website and domain. I had been using
  my Uncle's server space up until about a week ago, but thanks to a Christmas gift
  from his son/him, I was given my very own webspace and domain name for a year (thank
  you <a href=\"http://netfirms.com\" title=\"netfirms\">Netfirms</a> for your cheap
  webhosting service).\r\n\r\nFor those of you weren't directed to this blog from
  my site, check it out at <a href=\"http://greg-loesch.com\" title=\"greg-loesch\"
  target=\"_blank\">greg-loesch.com</a>. There's not a lot to it, as kinks are still
  being worked out, etc. If you have a Mac (or even if you don't, as I have some tips
  for PC users), make sure you check out my Mac Tips section. I may be migrating that
  over to Wordpress, as well, if I get ambitious. We'll see..."

  content: "Greg,\r\n\r\nDo you use Garage Band?  I have no knowledge of music, but
    I'm trying to start a little side business (www.schossadvertising.com) of advertising
    homes for people trying to sell for sale by owner.  I make video tours to put
    on the website, and I often need music for the video.  I have used some pop songs,
    but I don't think it's actually legal.  I've only done a couple of homes, so I
    haven't worried about it, but I've thought that I need to get someone to make
    me some music for the video tours."

  content: "Matt,\r\n\r\nYeah, I have dabbled in Garage Band a bit. I have some knowledge
    in the music area (suppose that's obvious with the whole keyboard thing, huh?),
    but I really haven't done a ton with it... finished products rarely, if ever,
    come out. Not sure my genre of \"composing\" would fit either (not sure I'm experienced
    enough to even say I have a \"genre\" but you get the idea), but I might have
    some time to finish something I started/throw something together this weekend.
    Then I could just shoot you an email with attachment. Perhaps this might motivate
    me to finish something. Ha ha, just let me know."

<p>I thought I'd be posting alot more over Christmas break, but I was most undoubtedly wrong. I mean it's not like I haven't been working on my website and such, I just have been busy tinkering with other things such as setting up this blog and purchasing/setting up my own personal website and domain. I had been using my Uncle's server space up until about a week ago, but thanks to a Christmas gift from his son/him, I was given my very own webspace and domain name for a year (thank you <a href="http://netfirms.com" title="netfirms">Netfirms</a> for your cheap webhosting service).</p>

<p>Over break, I've kept myself pretty busy. I have yet to find myself bored enough to admit that I'm bored. Being a first year college student, I've heard many people tell me that break really isn't that great because you get bored and sick of your parents and house. Call me crazy, but I greatly disagree. I'm not doing a whole lot of "productive" things by most people standards, so maybe that's why? Perhaps I have this great ability to entertain myself/keep myself busy... ha ha. Or maybe it's just because I'm blessed with awesome friends and family?</p>

<p>I'll take 'D' - all of the above, ha ha. But yeah, I've been busy hanging out with friends, messing around on the computer with my web stuff and music (got a new MIDI keyboard - M-Audio KeyStation 49e - for Christmas... my home setup can be seen above), sleeping, playing video games (GH3, Mario Galaxy, and NCAA '07), and watching movies... quite a few of them. I'll post my take on the movies soon. It may seem like a waste of time, but I'd like to think I'm taking advantage of my break. Lots of thinking has/is being done regarding a certain issue as well. I may post more about that whole mysterious issue later... more thinking must be done.</p>
<p>That basically sums up what I've been up to these past weeks. I've got about a week left, and I'm not look forward to going back. *Sigh* back to reality, right? Until next time...</p>
