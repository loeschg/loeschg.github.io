  content: That was an amazing performance!  Great job to the students and faculty!
    I am so impressed that they had such a diverse group involved and it's amazing
    to witness that level of commitment to put this all together... Way to keep school
    spirit and school unity alive!!

<p>Some fellow students of mine at the Ohio State University participated in a "flash mob" the other day at the Ohio Union, our new student union. I missed this by literally a few minutes. I went in to get tickets for something around 12:30pm. I thought there were an odd number of people just standing around doing "nothing." Kinda disappointed I missed it.</p>
<p>FYI: The guy walking with Brutus near the end is Gordon Gee, our school president.</p>
