<p>Ironically, they broke while I was describing to my cousin how I broke my last pair (before Bose shipped a new pair for free). I was saying "I simply pulled them like this.. *SNAP* ... and they broke..."</p>

<p>I took the picture immediately and emailed Bose. I'm hoping for the best :smile:</p>
<p>Until next time...</p>
