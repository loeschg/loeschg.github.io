<p>Don Miller responded within 24 hours of posting this, so there's no need for people to keep pestering him. Thanks Katelyn (<a title="Twitter - Katelyn Gerber" href="http://twitter.com/KatelynGerber">@KatelynGerber</a>) for using your persuasive charm! :)</p>
<hr />
<p>As people... as people with creativity and intelligence... as people with power, I ask that you join me in my official petition to Donald Miller, a well-known Christian author who wrote <em>Blue Like Jazz</em>. Keep reading... this may be the most important thing you do all day... all week... and... yeah, it's not that important, but I'd still appreciate the help.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px; "><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" title="Donald Miller" href="http://greg-loesch.com/blog/flickr/photo/3705537303/donald-miller.html"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2606/3705537303_ed2feaf5ec.jpg" alt="Donald Miller" width="295" height="269" /></a></span></p>
<p>Let me explain my situation and how you can help me out by taking just a few seconds out of your day. I am currently blocked from following Don Miller (<a title="Twitter - Don Miller" href="http://twitter.com/donmilleris">@donmilleris</a>) on Twitter, and I have no answers as to why this decision was made. Â He has over 15,000 followers, and I, Greg Loesch, a seemingly "nobody" as far as he would be concerned, am blocked from following his "tweets." Â I've made some attempts to get to the bottom of this, but all of them have ended in vain. By writing this, I run the risk of seeming possibly a little stalkerish. I simply desire to follow a guy on Twitter that has some thought-provoking ideas, a guy that I simply have a respect for.<br />
<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Here's where you can help me out</strong>.</p>
<p>It's a very simple process that will take you all of 15 seconds if you're a Twitter user. If not, it'll take you maybe 2 minutes to create a user name and then 15 seconds to send the reply... plus you'll finally have delved into one of the more mysterious and entertaining social networks.</p>
<p>I ask, as a fellow web citizen, that you follow these simple 2 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start Following Don Miller on Twitter (<a title="Don Miller - Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/donmilleris">@donmilleris</a>)</li>
<li>Send him the following tweet:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>@donmilleris LUCY! I respectfully ask that you unblock @compulsiveguile. Heâ€™s really a nice guy. Check out his letter <a href="http://bit.ly/T3ns6">http://bit.ly/T3ns6</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>For those of you questioning the "LUCY!" part, it's simply to get his attention. I hope by "screaming" the name of his chocolate lab, if nothing else, he will take at least a second glance at the tweets and maybe see a recurring pattern. The link is simply to my "letter" to Don Miller, asking him to unblock me, or at least explain why I was blocked. You can see it by clicking <a title="Letter to Don Miller" href="http://is.gd/1vsTh">here</a>.</p>
<p>Any Stumble or Digg support you could give me would be awesome! I appreciate any of you willing to help me out. I hope I can one day repay the favor...</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Greg Loesch</p>
