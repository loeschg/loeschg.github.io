  content: He he.  I read the postings out of order (my RSS feed).  Obviously, you
    changed the design.

  content: "Yes, I most definitely did. I was running into a few issues that I could
    not change with the other theme. Plus, I like the added navigation bar (I don't
    know how to code one myself). If I don't like this one, however, it's an easy
    switch back. Ah, the beauty of Wordpress :)\r\n\r\nSomething that might be throwing
    your RSS feed off is the fact that I added a \"sticky\" post to my blog. The post
    you see at the top of my site will always on top from this point on. \r\n\r\nJust
    curious, which look do you like better?"

<p>Due to some of my frustrations with the limitations of the other template, I'm testing out other Wordpress themes. Until I get some of the kinks worked out, you'll have to deal with some of the aesthetic blemishes on my site :-).</p>
<p>If you'd like, leave me a comment letting me know what you think of my new look. As of right now, I'm liking it. Eh, we'll see.</p>
<p>Until next time...</p>
