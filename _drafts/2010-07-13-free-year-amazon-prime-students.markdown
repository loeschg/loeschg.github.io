<p>I just wanted to make a quick post sharing the good news. If you're a student with a .edu email address, you're eligible for a free year of Amazon Prime! I just signed up, and the process was very quick. I don't think any strings are attached... just to be safe you might set up a reminder in your calendar a year from now to check and make sure there is no auto-renewal.</p>
<p>For those of you who like to buy books online instead of in overpriced college bookstores, make sure you take advantage of this. Free 2-day shipping and more? Heck ya. Keep in mind that this won't include all 3rd party sellers that just post on Amazon. Hard to beat free, though. Enjoy!</p>
