<p>Alright then, here goes another weekend update. Hopefully this entry finds all you, friends and family, doing well. This is proving to be a long entry... so pace yourself.</p>
<p class="paragraph_style">This past week went alright. Nothing terribly special happened that I can remember. The low point was definitely gettinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ exams back (one in particular).

<p class="paragraph_style" align="left">So Friday after classes, I went with some of the guys from my hall to play some indoor soccer <a id="more"></a><a id="more-23"></a>up at the rec. This sadly was the first time that I actually had gone to the rec to do something physical since being here a month (I went once to sign up for intramural soccer... so eat it). I had a good time - though I felt like my lungs were going to explode - just playing pickup games with the guys. Not to brag or anything *stretches arms*, but we beat some foreign guys (we called em Ã¢â‚¬Å“FrenchiesÃ¢â‚¬Â... is that bad?) pretty handily. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not really sure how it happened, but yeah... we should probably be the US national team now.</p>

<p class="paragraph_style">Ha ha, anyways... Friday night consisted of watching the Indians and just chillinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ with some of the guys.  I initially thought it was pretty lame, but looking back, I had a good time. Starting with the Indians... heck yeah. I watched the game with 1-2 other guy(s) (one kept coming in and out, then left to participate in a hide-and-seek tournament?). That was the most excited IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve gotten watching sports in awhile. Jared, the guy I was watching with, predicted like every crucial pitch correctly... I guess he could because he caught for his HS baseball team. It was impressive. But seriously, how sweet was that game? Studly Carmona, the bugs, the wild pitches, and hott hitting Hafner. That sums it up.</p>

<p class="paragraph_style">After that, some of the guys just chilled in my room. Ha ha, the highlight of that event was definitely the kid that lives 2-doors down from me. His nameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Spencer, and the only thing I can describe him as is a more social, lively Chris Free for those who I went to school with. This guy is absolutely brilliant and lives for music and trivia. Our RA was trying to think of stereotypical Ã¢â‚¬Å“emoÃ¢â‚¬Â songs, and when Spencer heard somebody say that in the hallway, he all but literally flew out of his room to join (this kid is usually in bed by 10:00 or earlier, mind you) our 11:30 conversation. He then went on to tell us of his... Ã¢â‚¬Å“adventuresÃ¢â‚¬Â in the world of academic challenge / quiz team. It was literally a sport for him. Every home match, they dressed up in costumes to give you an idea... Ha ha, it was funny. I spent the rest of the night workinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ on my site (check out the Mac section if you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t). If you have anything youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to see as the next article for the Mac section, let me know. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m thinking apps...</p>

<p>Saturday I did nothing until our first home hockey game started at 7:00PM. The Goggin Arena is... awesome. We played Waterloo (some Canadian school), and destroyed them 5-0. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re ranked like #5 in the USA Today polls. Aside from some crass chants, the game was awesome. Ask me about the hockey chants sometime, I guess, if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re interested. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m lookinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ forward to the next one already. Some schools have football... we have hockey (and... synchronized skating). Speaking of football... we WON! Yes, the Miami University football team won another game! We beat Kent (eat it Ashleigh and Kelsey :-) and are now 2-0 in the big MAC. Look out OSU...</p>

<p class="paragraph_style">After the game, Tex, my half-Korean brother, and I went to Wal-Mart with some other girls. We shopped for probably 2 million hours *thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a coma, dude*, and then finally went back to campus with the intent of watching a movie. We ended up takinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ a walk back on the trail in the woods at like 12. Two of the girls were a little squeemish, so we trekked out of the woods around 1 and headed to watch House of D (with Robin William). I had never heard of it, but I ended up liking it. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitely not a Ã¢â‚¬Å“lightÃ¢â‚¬Â movie. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an emotionally stimulating movie. To be honest, it reminded me a little bit of Good Will Hunting, but not as amazing. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not really sure why though. It had itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s odd parts, but overall it was pretty decent. It was kind of kool seeing a day with no plans turn into a pretty sweet night. It seems like itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been awhile since something like that worked out.</p>

<p style="padding-bottom: 0pt" class="paragraph_style">Well, that about wraps up the weekend. Check back later this week, as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll try to update again before the weekend. Until next time...</p>
