excerpt: "Not too long ago, Google introduced a pretty neat phone/voicemail service
  called Google Voice. Signing up for the service provides you with a single phone
  number that can be linked to multiple phones (home, cell, work), allows for free
  text messaging, provides discounted long-distance calls, offers voicemail transcriptions
  (as text messages), and so much more... all for the wonderful price of FREE. I don't
  utilize all the features, but I do like the option of managing voicemail online.\r\n<p

<p>Not too long ago, Google introduced a pretty neat phone/voicemail service called Google Voice. Signing up for the service provides you with a single phone number that can be linked to multiple phones (home, cell, work), allows for free text messaging, provides discounted long-distance calls, offers voicemail transcriptions (as text messages), and so much more... all for the wonderful price of FREE.

<p>Google Voice is still in beta, and invitations have become a bit <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">difficult</span> inconvenient to come by as of late. I have seen/received several comments saying that invites were not being sent out as frequently by Google. However, <strong>good news has arrived! Google just announced yesterday that they are rolling out invites for all students!</strong> <a id="more"></a><a id="more-609"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The only requirement is that you sign up with a .edu email address. They claim that the invite will be sent out within 24 hours of the request. Note: you don't have to link that specific email address with Google Voice. You can connect it with a current Gmail account.</p>
<p>So go sign up with your college emails or find a college student who's not <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">technically inclined</span> interested in getting a Google Voice account/invite at this moment in time! Link is here -&gt; <a title="Google Voice Students" href="http://www.google.com/googlevoice/students.html">google.com/googlevoice/students.html</a>. Assure them that they'll be able to get one later when the service comes out of beta. If you have invites, share the wealth :).</p>
