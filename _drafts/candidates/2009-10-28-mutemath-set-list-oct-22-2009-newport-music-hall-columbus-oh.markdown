excerpt: '<p style="text-align: left;">A friend of mine recently "rekindled" my interest
  for MuteMath by raving about their latest album <em>Armistice</em>. With a local
  MuteMath concert on the horizon, I picked up the latest album on amazon for like
  $8 and gave ''er a listen. After my infatuation stage of <em>Armistice</em> passed,
  it stood as a solid album, yet it still remained off my top 10. I have had MuteMath''s
  self-titled album for some time, but it had long since fallen from the forefront
  of my frequently played tuneage. In my mind they were good, but they didn''t quite
  hit the bulls-eye. Enter the MuteMath concert<em>.'

    posted of their tour this yr... I am going to see them for the first time this
    Friday and am incredibly excited - even moreso now knowing that they also played
    a lot of songs off of their self titled album! \r\n\r\nThanks for sharing!!"

<p style="text-align: left;">A friend of mine recently "rekindled" my interest for MuteMath by raving about their latest album <em>Armistice</em>. With a local MuteMath concert on the horizon, I picked up the latest album on amazon for like $8 and gave 'er a listen. After my infatuation stage of <em>Armistice</em> passed, it stood as a solid album, yet it still remained off my top 10. I have had MuteMath's self-titled album for some time, but it had long since fallen from the forefront of my frequently played tuneage. In my mind they were good, but they didn't quite hit the bulls-eye. Enter the MuteMath concert<em>.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-536"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://emberapp.com/compulsiveguile/images/mutemath-armistice/sizes/m.png" alt="MuteMath" /><br />
<em> </em>MuteMath put on the type of show/concert that I believe firmly plants the band in the list of my favorites. One could argue that my appreciation grew due to the fact that I started listening to MuteMath with more "depth" (I started listened to the tracks on the albums in order, I actually read the lyrics, etc.), which is probably somewhat true, but there's something to be said about the connection MuteMath  made with its listeners/concert attenders.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I'm not going to name specifics of the concert (to save from over/under hyping their performance), but it was quite an experience. Percussion drives the show. One could also argue that who you go with to the concert makes all the difference... which is also probably a valid point. (I did go with a sweet group of people I had just met, and several of my close friends were at the concert, too). Again, regardless of all the possible bias, MuteMath put on quite a show, and you should definitely try to see them in concert if you get the opportunity.</p>
<p>For any of you looking to re-live (or pretend to live) the concert experience or just looking for a good MuteMath playlist, here's the set list from the MuteMath concert at Newport Music Hall on October 22, 2009 in Columbus, OH:</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure of "Collapse" at #10... it may have actually been a different instrumental. If you know for sure, feel free to correct me by posting a comment below.</p>
<p>Until next time...</p>
