  was standing like 3 people down from me listening to one of the openers... pretty
  awesome).\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://api.ning.com/files/A9uORBMIi4Us67asYlPT62DFRrdsq*K8V3QwJkt2R651Moklau60LAKz*x3Vi1zkfsN0t4HTfSQv4IoMN5oODfXMh*VUOudu/afternoon.jpg\"

<p>I just went a Mae concert on 11.1.09 at Skully's Bar &amp; Grill in Columbus, OH, and as usual, I kept record of their set list. It was an overall good concert, and the small venue made for a pretty cool experience. The band members were practically standing next to me in the front row (at one point in time, the lead singer of Mae was standing like 3 people down from me listening to one of the openers... pretty awesome).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://api.ning.com/files/A9uORBMIi4Us67asYlPT62DFRrdsq*K8V3QwJkt2R651Moklau60LAKz*x3Vi1zkfsN0t4HTfSQv4IoMN5oODfXMh*VUOudu/afternoon.jpg" alt="" width="253" height="326" /><a id="more"></a><a id="more-550"></a></p>
<p>Three bands opened for Mae, one of which was a band called <em>Deas Vail</em> (the others I didn't care for... so I'm not listing them... mainly because I don't remember their names...). In all honesty, I thought <em>Deas Vail</em> was spectacular. The lead singer's incredibly smooth and mellow vocals seemed effortless. The falsetto tone is a bit reminiscent of Copeland. The band as a whole came across as very likable and down-to-earth. I think I may have a bit of a crush on the female keyboardist, but she didn't seem to have much of an interest in me... *sigh.* Laura, if you're reading this, feel free to email me.Â  Maybe we can hang out some time. Act quickly though, as I won't wait around for you forever... don't flatter yourself. Moving on...</p>
<p>Mae was pretty fantastic in my opinion. Their sound wasn't flawless... but all the more credit to them for actually playing the music live. From my understanding, Mae has undergone some pretty crazy band transitions (their amazing keyboardist from The Everglow days is gone along with a few other members), so they weren't able to perform all of my favorites (<em>We're So Far Away </em>for one). The new keyboardist looks to have some skills (and decent vocals), so I'm looking forward to hearing what he was to offer in the future.</p>
<p>Here's Mae's set list. They mixed it up pretty well and gave us a sneak peak at a song from their new (A)fternoon EP (I picked this EP up at the concert... pretty good stuff).</p>
