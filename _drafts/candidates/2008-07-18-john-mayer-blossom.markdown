excerpt: 'This is a similar post as the Jack Johnson one I made about a month ago.
  I went to John Mayer''s concert last night at Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls,
  and I kept track of the songs he played in the order he performed them. This list
  isn''t exactly cut and dry, as Mayer does a lot of improv that can''t exactly be
  listed as a song. '

  content: Nice little blog there Mr L.  Though i didn't go...I can say that Johnson
    set a freakin high bar to be sure. That much I do know, cause I was there...and
    it was great...no speeches...lots of songs, and as you said, a better sound than
    the solar powered recorded albums!!  But seriously...that tank is sexy...okay
    I said not that

<p>This is a similar post as the Jack Johnson one I made about a month ago. I went to John Mayer's concert last night at Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls, and I kept track of the songs he played in the order he performed them. This list isn't exactly cut and dry, as Mayer does a lot of improv that can't exactly be listed as a song. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-123"></a></p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Good Love is on the Way - John Mayer Trio</li>
<li>Bigger Than My Body - Heavier Things</li>
<li>I Don't Trust Myself (With Loving You) - Continuum</li>
<li>Belief - Continuum</li>
<li>Stop This Train - Continuum</li>
<li>Slow Dancing in a Burning Room - Continuum</li>
<li>Free Fallin' (Tom Petty Cover)</li>
<li>Waiting on the World to Change - Continuum (prefaced this song with... an interesting speech)</li>
<li>Blues improv (might have possibly been a song I didn't know)</li>
<li>Why Georgia - Room for Squares</li>
<li>Vultures - Continuum (started with more Blues improv into a sweet intro)</li>
<li>Gravity - Continuum</li>
<li>Something's Missing - Heavier Things</li>
<li>Get Out of My Life Woman (Lee Dorsey cover)</li>
<li>Say (New Single)</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm still trying to determine how much I liked the whole concert experience. I missed the 1st guy because of a group Chipotle craving (I can live with that... I'm usually not impressed with openers), Colbie Caillat was a disappointment, there were a lot of songs I wanted Mayer to play that he didn't, I got a little tired of his improv, and - I'm not one to judge a guy's outfit normally, mind you - the guy wore a man-tank! Ha ha, really? I blame Jennifer Aniston. Yeah yeah, I know I complain. Don't get me wrong, the guy's extremely gifted at playing guitar. After awhile though, I felt like "Yeah I know you're super awesome at guitar, John. My guitar skills multiplied by 5,981 are still not even close to being equal to yours. Now that the realization has been made, play the songs we can sing-a-long to... please."</p>

<p>Maybe I like too many of his songs and expected a bit too much. Jack Johnson played nearly 30 songs, and they sounded as good if not better than the albums themselves. What can I say, JJ set the bar pretty high. If nothing else, I can say I saw Mayer in concert, right? Ha ha, well if anyone has corrections to my listing, feel free to post a comment below. No need to register, log-in, or anything of that sort.</p>
<p>Until next time...</p>
