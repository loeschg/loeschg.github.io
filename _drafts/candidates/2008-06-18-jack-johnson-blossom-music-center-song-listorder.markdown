    what happened.  That's dang cool you've been to Jack Johnson.  What a stud.  I
    bought his new album.  I'll have to look at that song list.\r\n\r\nI've been busy
    with two crazy boys, and putting a yard in our new house.  Ugh.\r\n\r\nMatt"

  content: "Jack is indeed a stud.\r\n\r\nHa ha, two crazy boys and yard work doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t
    sound too bad. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d say itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re busy with your
    boys rather than with work ;-)\r\n\r\nYeahÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ I thought I was going to have
    more time this summer to mess around with my website, but I forgot how much time
    goes into working full time. There were a lot of things I was hoping to do this
    summer that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t shaping up how I wanted. *sigh*\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nIn case
    you read the comment before I edited it, I found your site. I didn't realize you
    were using Tumblr (opposed to Stumble Upon)."

  content: You should publish this list to iTunes and email me the link.  I'm looking
    for more music to put on my web page.

    know how I missed it. I know itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a bit late now, but I will still publish
    it to iTunes if I remember. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never done it before, so this would be
    a good learning experience :smile:."

    whatever reason, your comment came to my email and not here on the site. That
    may have been intentional, but I think this is helpful information :smile:\r\n\r\nI
    published the playlist, and I can send you the link if you'd like. I'd do it now,
    but I'm at work without access to iTunes..."

    my site, the rss button in the url bar (if Firefox or Safari, too, I believe).
    If that all fails, try manually adding <a href="http://greg-loesch.com/blog/feed/"

<p>I just went to Jack Johnson's concert at Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls, OH last night, and it was unbelievable. He played nearly 30 songs, and they all sounded exactly like they do on the albums. If you're a Jack Johnson fan, you HAVE to go to his concert sometime.</p>
<p>If any of you are like me, you want to relive concert experiences. The closest thing to it is listening to the songs in the same order he performed them in the concert. I usually don't think to record the song order at the concert, but this time I was smart (thanks, Schotty).</p>
<p>In case any of you were wanting the song list, here she is.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://greg-loesch.com/blog/blog.pics/2008/06/picture-11.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-96 aligncenter" title="Song List" src="http://greg-loesch.com/blog/blog.pics/2008/06/picture-11-300x164.png" alt="" width="300" height="164" /></a></p>
<p>I found #15 (Girl, I Wanna Lay You Down), #23 (Mason Jennings - Living in the Moment), and #24 (Plastic Jesus... though it's a video) on iTunes. The rest were from his albums.</p>
<p>If any of you have corrections, please let me know, and I'll be sure to post those right away. Enjoy and until next time...</p>

<p>EDIT: For those of you interested, here's a <a title="Blossomin' with JJ - iTunes playlist" href="http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/browserRedirect?url=itms%253A%252F%252Fax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net%252FWebObjects%252FMZStore.woa%252Fwa%252FviewIMix%253Fid%253D286850877" target="_blank">link</a> to the playlist in iTunes. When you click the link, a pop-up will appear asking your permission to open iTunes. Be trusting and just say yes :) .</p>
