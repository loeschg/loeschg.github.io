  content: "It is ironic that MY Senator, Sherrod Brown, wants to protect me from
    MY ignorance of the \"internet dangers\", but he also is for gun control!  He
    also supports the biggest THREAT to our freedom in the new millenia.....Barack
    Hussein Obama!\r\nPS: the \"Justice\" Department cannot even protect us from vote
    fraud nor can it protect us from illegal alien incursion!  This is all a joke.......I
    am not laughing!"

  content: "I got the same form letter.. here my response to it..\r\n\r\nThank you
    for taking the time to respond to my concerns.\r\n\r\nIt appears that you are
    on the fence with regards to SOPA and PIPA.  I agree that consumers need to be
    protected from  unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent marketplace practices, however,
    there needs to be limits to the freedoms which would be taken away by this legislation.
    \ Musicians, producers, filmmakers, software designers, etc should be adapting
    to changes in technology, yet they haven't. The success of Apples iTunes service
    is a perfect example of when a service is executed correctly, it can flourish
    and make a profit.  I will be the first to admit that I have not read the legislation
    at hand, but I believe I have heard enough to realize that this is not good for
    the people in this country.  Most people do not realize that the majority of these
    issues which this legislation would attempt to \"fix\" were in fact caused by
    the backers of this legislation, and their failure to adapt to the ever changing
    world of technology.\r\n\r\nAuto Manufacturers who build cars which are able to
    break the speed limit (which is illegal),  do not sit on the sides of the highway
    with radar guns taking speeds and reporting them to the authorities.  Nor would
    the congress attempt to pass legislation which would force the automakers to produce
    cars with a top speed of 65 mph.  It's up to the end user to use the auto in a
    legal way, and it's not up to the auto manufacture to make sure that they are
    used legally\r\n\r\nGuns are used in millions of illegal crimes every year, yet
    it's still legal to purchase and possess a gun.  It's up to the end user to use
    the gun in a legal and safe way.  It's not up to the gun manufactures to make
    sure that they are used legally.\r\n\r\nWe do not limit speeds which cars can
    travel because of those who use cars illegally, We do prohibit the sale and use
    of guns because of those who use them illegally, and we should not put censorship
    limitations, and police state monitoring on the internet because of those who
    use the internet illegally.  Let those companies who support SOPA and PIPA go
    to China and Iran where you can already see the results of what this legislation
    would result in.\r\n\r\nYou can see where the real problem of piracy on the internet
    has spawned from in this YouTube video http://youtu.be/WJIuYgIvKsc\r\n\r\nIf this
    legislation gets passed, then we might as well install speed monitors in all cars,
    cameras in all houses, do away with guns, heck lets just rip up the constitution,
    do away with Miranda, hire x KGB agents to spy on our citizens.  Better yet, why
    don't we just merge with China or Iran, they seem to already have these processes
    down pat!\r\n\r\nThomas Prevett, North Ridgeville, Ohio,\r\nSoon to be known as
    \"Citizen Prevett\""

<div>The following is an email I received from Senator Sherrod Brown in response to an email I sent containing my SOPA/PIPA concerns.</div>

<div>Dear Mr. Loesch,</div></p>
<div>Thank you for sharing your thoughts about legislation to combat online infringement and digital theft.</div></p>

<div>Last Congress, the Senate considered, but did not pass, legislation entitled the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA).  The aim of this legislation was to assist the Department of Justice in tracking and shutting down "rogue websites."  These sites provide unauthorized downloads, streaming, or direct sale of copyrighted material.  Similar legislation, entitled the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property (PROTECT IP) Act, was recently introduced in the Senate.  The PROTECT IP Act narrows the definition of "rogue website" in an effort to target only the most egregious purveyors of digital theft and counterfeit crime.</div>
<div></div></p>
<div>In an age of advancing technology, it is critical we have laws that protect internet users from unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent marketplace practices.  Too many consumers today purchase goods over the internet that may pose a significant threat to their health and wellbeing.   For example, a consumer may unknowingly purchase counterfeit prescription drugs online that contain incorrect amounts of active ingredients, and thus pose a serious risk to ill individuals.</div></p>
<div>Additionally, illegal file sharing and unauthorized copying of digital material prevents musicians, producers, filmmakers, software designers, and many others from reaping the fruits of their labor.  Such activity has the potential to stifle artistic creativity and compromise electronic innovation.  Ultimately, intellectual property theft costs our economy billions of dollars and can result in hundreds of thousands of lost jobs.</div></p>
<div>However, I have also heard from individuals with concerns about the scope of this legislation, as well as its First Amendment implications.  I take these concerns seriously.  Should this legislation come before the full Senate for a vote, I will keep your views in mind.  Thank you again for getting in touch with me.</div></p>
<div>                         Sincerely,</div></p>
<div>                         Sherrod Brown</div>
<div>                         United States Senator</div></p>
