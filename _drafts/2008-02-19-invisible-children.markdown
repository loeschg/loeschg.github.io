excerpt: 'I just re-watched a documentary/film this evening that I had seen about
  a year ago, and I thought if nothing else, I can add a quick blog entry about it.
  It''s calledÃ‚Â <a href="http://invisiblechildren.com" title="Invisible Children">Invisible
  Children</a>,Ã‚Â and it''s about the children in Uganda who are in constant hiding
  due to fear of being kidnapped and conscripted into the LRA. It''s... quite moving.
  It helped me take another little step in shaping my perspective of my life.<p style="font:

    DO SOMETHING...but then your mind faces the fact that it is just too big. I struggle

<p>I just re-watched a documentary/film this evening that I had seen about a year ago, and I thought if nothing else, I can add a quick blog entry about it. It's calledÃ‚Â <a href="http://invisiblechildren.com" title="Invisible Children">Invisible Children</a>,Ã‚Â and it's about the children in Uganda who are in constant hiding due to fear of being kidnapped and conscripted into the LRA.

<p>Check out the trailer below. If you're interested in the full movie, watch itÃ‚Â <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3166797753930210643&amp;q=invisible+children&amp;total=1994&amp;start=0&amp;num=10&amp;so=0&amp;type=search&amp;plindex=0" title="Invisible Children - Vid">here</a>.

<p>Ã‚Â I'm struggling with the whole "doing out of felt obligation" and "doing because I really feel led to" with this whole situation, if you understand where I'm coming from. It's just... hard to feel like I can have an impact. I don't want to discourage any of you; I'm just sharing my thoughts. It has to start somewhere though. I hate acting on compulsion, yet I can't help but wonder if there's nothing wrong with that in this situation. I'll be tossing some stuff around in my mind, and I'll be praying for the situation. It's the least I can do.Ã‚Â Until next time...Ã‚Â </p>
