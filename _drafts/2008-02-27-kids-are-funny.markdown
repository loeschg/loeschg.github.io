<p>This will be one of my shortest posts ever. I just have to document this somewhere. While volunteering at an after-school program, I was privileged to hear some kid yell in excitement/frustration, "Oh cricket cucumbers!" That's a pretty funny visual right there.</p>
<p>It made me laugh.</p>
<p>The End.</p>
<p>Until next time...</p>
