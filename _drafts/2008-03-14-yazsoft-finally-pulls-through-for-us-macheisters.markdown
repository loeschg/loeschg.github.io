  For those of you who are left out in the cold, I wrote about a controversial business/marketing "stunt" that a software company, Yazsoft (creators of Speed Download app), pulled on all participants of a widely known Mac software distributor, MacHeist. A major PAID Speed Download upgrade was released soon after the MacHeist ended, and it caused an uproar.

  Neither MacHeist nor Yazsoft would back down, and all participants of the software bundle were left wondering what was to happen next. (If you're interested in reading more, check out my blog entryÃ‚Â <a href="http://greg-loesch.com/blog/?p=64" title="MacHeist vs Yazsoft">here</a>). Well... now we can put all of this behind us.

<p>For those of you who are left out in the cold, I wrote about a controversial business/marketing "stunt" that a software company, Yazsoft (creators of Speed Download app), pulled on all participants of a widely known Mac software distributor, MacHeist. A major PAID Speed Download upgrade was released soon after the MacHeist ended, and it caused an uproar.</p>
<p>Neither MacHeist nor Yazsoft would back down, and all participants of the software bundle were left wondering what was to happen next. (If you're interested in reading more, check out my blog entryÃ‚Â <a href="http://greg-loesch.com/blog/?p=64" title="MacHeist vs Yazsoft">here</a>). Well... now we can put all of this behind us.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-85"></a><br />
Today Yazsoft and MacHeist finally released their final agreement regarding the controversial Speed Download 5 paid upgrade. Interestingly enough, Yazsoft even gave us a couple different options!Ã‚Â The final resolution stated that we could could do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay $15, get 2 licenses of SD5, and receive a free upgrade to SD6.Ã‚Â </li>
<li>Upgrade to SD5 for free, end of story. No discounts for SD6 or multiple licenses.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="white-space: pre" class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Or...</p>
<ul>
<li>Users that had already purchased SD5 could either elect to get their money back (and thus lose one license that they received for free), or they could "show their support" and opt to do nothing (equivalent to 1st option)</li>
</ul>
<p>The catch? This offer only stands for the next 14 days (March 13th-27th). I'm sure Yazsoft is banking on several MacHeisters not finding out about this until the deadline has passed, so hopefully MacHeist sends an email out to all its customers.Ã‚Â I now will rest with content :-).</p>

<p>I'm now downloading Nine Inch Nails new album "Ghosts" since they elected to go the Radiohead route (<a href="http://greg-loesch.com/blog/?p=24" title="Radiohead">see Radiohead blog entry</a>). They're offering 9 (of 36) of the songs free (DRM free too!) and a digital download of all 36 for a mere $5. I had no idea if I even like their music (and still don't), but hey... it's free (the legal way) right? From what I understand and have listened to so far, it's all instrumental (and a little dark). You should check it out if you haven't. Here's the link to theirÃ‚Â <a href="http://ghosts.nin.com/main/home" title="Ghosts I-IV">order page</a>.Ã‚Â </p>
<p>Alright, that's all.Ã‚Â Until next time...Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â </p>
