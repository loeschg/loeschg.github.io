<p>One of my friends that's currently teaching and working in an orphanage in Cambodia just recently posted a pic on his blog showing something he found at the orphanage. He aptly titled his post "<a title="Things that make you say hmmmm" href="http://grahamgeisler.blogspot.com/2009/03/things-that-make-you-say-hmmmm.html">Things that make you say hmmmm</a>"</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_rajXDjpm5Ps/ScH-2UU_omI/AAAAAAAALaw/X3AgUznzAF0/s400/03+Things+that+make+you+say+hmmm.jpg" alt="Suck Jelly" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He says that he has no idea what it is.</p>
