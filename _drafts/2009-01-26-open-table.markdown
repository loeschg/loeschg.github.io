excerpt: '<p style="text-align: left;">I was looking at some of my feeds after class
  not too long ago (I may have had over 6,000 unread...), and I came across a blog
  post by <a title="Don Miller" href="http://donmilleris.com/2009/01/15/the-open-table/">Don
  Miller</a>, the author of Blue Like Jazz. It was regarding a new... project I''d
  guess you''d say... that involved 5 interview questions that he asked 25 of his
  friends. They are kind of thought provoking, and I just kinda enjoyed watching the
  little sample video that they have on YouTube. Even if you think this is a stupid
  idea, definitely check out the interview around the 0:46 second mark. He made me
  laugh...'

  content: 'I just wanted you to know that I thought it was interesting how the guy
    at the :46 second mark referred to Christianity as a cult. In a sense, don''t
    you think every religion is some sort of cult? Oh, and just a word of advice:
    Don''t worry too often about what you''re missing out on. Focus on what''s there
    in the present. Have you ever seen horror movies where the victim is running from
    the killer, the whole time looking behind their back, when suddenly they turn
    around and the guy is right there in front of them? Ok, maybe that wasn''t a good
    analogy. But you get the point, right? :)Peace'

  content: "Without getting too much into it, no, I don't think all religions are
    cults. The definition of \"cult\" can take on a lot of different meanings... most
    implying a false belief. As a follower of Jesus Christ, I don't consider Christianity
    false. Also, I believe that guy now proclaims himself as a Christian. Not positive
    though...\r\n\r\nHa ha, with or without the analogy, you offer good advice. I
    appreciate it.\r\n\r\n:grin:"

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In case you were interested, here are the 5 questions.</span></p>
<p>1. What did you think of God/Christians before you became a Christian?</p>
<p>2. When did you realize there was a dark or hard side to life?</p>
<p>3. When did you realize there was a dark or hard side to yourself?</p>
<p>4. What did it look like when God broke into your world?</p>
<p>5. What does your life look like now?</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I'd have no way to answer #1, as I've called myself a "Christian" as far as I can think back.Â  Obviously there came a time when my faith became <em>mine</em> opposed to my parents, but I've often wondered if I am missing out on something special in the Christian life... that ability to go back and reflect on what life was like before Christ. No awesome "conversion" story for me.</p>
