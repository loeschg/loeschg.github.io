<p>This post is more to spread the word than anything else. Not all of you will share the excitement, I'm sure, but in case one or two you might... it'd be worth it :-). This can be a dream for the average web-designer.</p>

<p>Let me give you an idea of how sweet this deal is. Snapz Pro X is the best screen-casting software out there for Mac, and it alone costs $69! I received Snapz for Christmas this year, and I know that full-price was paid for it. To make it worse for me, this bundle also includes Pixelmator, a sort of up-and-coming photo-editing app that costs $59 alone, that I DID NOT receive for Christmas. I could have gotten BOTH of them AND $20 for the price that my parents paid for Snapz, if this would have been available BEFORE Christmas.</p>
<p class="paragraph_style">&nbsp;</p>
<p>BAH! Ha ha, I'm not bitter I promise.  Pixelmator is no Photoshop, but it is the fastest way to edit a picture. It's actually the reason I bought this bundle myself. This program has more than enough bells and whistles for photo-editing, and it loads in literally 5 seconds. It's perfect for web-designers like myself, and it's also a very well designed program aesthetically speaking. Visit their <a href="http://pixelmator.com" title="Pixelmator" target="_blank">site</a>, you'll want to buy it. I promise you :-). Note: this bundle also includes AppZapper, a convenient app uninstaller. It blows AppCleaner (Free) out of the water.</p>

<p>I hardly EVER buy software. Understand that doesn't mean I pirate, as I'm very much against it, I just try to find a free alternative for everything I ever want/need. However, I'm finding that certain apps are worth being paid for.</p>

<p>Well, just wanted to share the info. I know this will make all of what I just said sound like a sales pitch (and I promise this wasn't my intention), but I figure it can't hurt. If I get one person to buy this package from this referring link, I get a free app. If two do, I get another free app. I figure if somebody wants to buy this, why not help a guy out ;-). If you do buy this package, do me a favor and buy it through this link <a href="https://www.macheist.com/buy/invite/94351" title="MacHeist">here</a>.</p>

<p>Well, until next time...</p>
