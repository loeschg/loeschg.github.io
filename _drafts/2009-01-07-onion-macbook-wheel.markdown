<p>For those of you who haven't seen the Onion's latest video about Apple's "Revolutionary New Laptop," you should check out the video below. Ha ha, it's been awhile since I'd seen an Onion vid, and this didn't disappoint. The guy at the end talking about the reasons he was going to buy it was hilarious. Let's hope all of us Apple supporters don't really sound like that...</p>
<p>I'm impressed by how real that thing looks... props to you Onion guys (... and girls).</p>
